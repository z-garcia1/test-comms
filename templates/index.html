Note the use of the lowercase k in ku. 1L modulation 1L modulation (note the lowercase "m") is a proprietary TI technology that halves the inductor count in an inductor-capacitor (LC) filter integrated into one of our audio amplifiers. We do not capitalize the word modulation because modulation is a common noun and because there is another product, also in the amplifier space, that uses both the term "1L" and "Modulation," made by another company: https://www.belar.com/FMCS-1L/20160601_FMCS-1L_Literature.pdf. Define the concept of 1L as one inductor on first reference, as you would any abbreviation or acronym. Example: TI's one-inductor (1L) modulation technology maintains Class-D amplifier performance but decreases the number of inductors per channel by half, which leads to decreased system-level costs and a device that’s 50% smaller and lighter. 3-state (adj.) Avoid. See "tri-state" entry. 4-20 mA Because 4-20 mA is an industry de facto standard 4–20 mA current loop for process control applications, the normal rules of hyphenating 4-20 mA as a a modifier do not apply. about, around, the tilde (~), approximately Avoid "around" and "about" when referring to a number and a measurement. "Approximately" is the most appropriate substitution. Do not use the tilde (~) in TI content. The Japanese language has a similar-looking symbol (～) that means "maximum" or "by." So there could be a significant misunderstanding if you mean "about a 35°C temperature rise" or that the peak current-sense voltage is "about 150 mV," but when the content is translated, Japanese readers will infer that you meant "a maximum 35°C temperature rise" or a "maximum 150 mV." Instead of the tilde, say "approximately," "an approximate" or whatever fits the context. If the content is severely space-constrained such as in a table, use the approximately equal symbol (≅) rather than the tilde. above, below, higher, lower Avoid "above" and "below" in the context of units of value/test measurements. It is OK to say "higher than" or "lower than" such contexts. Example: Figure 5 lists the minimum charge pump current requirement for designs lower than 100 W. AC/DC, DC/DC TI uses a slash in AC/DC and DC/DC, not a hyphen. Note that AC and DC are on the small list of acronyms that the Associated Press does not require spelling out on first reference. AC/DC (n) Note the slash. Do not use a hyphen. You do not need to spell out AC/DC for alternating current/direct current. It is one of the Associated Press' acronyms that are "acceptable in all uses." ACKed (v), ACK (n) acronym definition websites Some acronym definition lists will capitalize each word of a spelled-out term, just as a convention, but remember to lowercase common nouns. Just because a spelled-out term can be an acronym does not make the individual words in the term proper nouns or otherwise "important." Infolink's list: https://infolink.sc.ti.com/news_rooms/p/acronyms For TI packaging: http://www.ti.com/support-packaging/packaging-resources/packaging-terminology.html Seimconductor technology acronyms: http://maltiel-consulting.com/Semiconductor_Technology_Acronyms_List_maltiel_consulting.htm#Top Everything else: http://www.acronymfinder.com/ acronyms that AP says you don't have to spell out These are in alphabetical order and updated at any time that AP states that an acronym is "acceptable in all references." AC API CEO CPU DC GUI HDMI HTTP IT LTE PC PIN (for personal identification number, not for pins on a device) R&D RAM S&P 500 SD SUV USB 3G, 4G, 5G HD, LCD, LED and 4K are acceptable on first reference, but should be spelled out and explained if a story dives into technological detail. acronyms we don't have to spell out first When the Associated Press decides that an acronym has enough recognition that there is no need to define it, it will say that the acronym is "acceptable in all uses." There are only a handful of terms from the high-tech industry on this list. They include: AC API CEO CPU DC GUI HDMI HTTP IT LTE PC PIN (for personal identification number, not for pins on a device) R&D RAM S&P 500 SD SUV USB 3G, 4G, 5G HD, LCD, LED and 4K are acceptable on first reference, but should be spelled out and explained if a story dives into technological detail. active low (n), active high (n) Do not hyphenate these terms. active vs. passive voice Do not write in the passive voice unless the action is truly more important than the subject performing that action. Writing in the passive voice is against the TI brand voice guidelines. The passive voice will always include a form of “to be” along with the past-participle form of a verb. Look for am, is, are, was, were, be, being or been, along with a verb ending in -ed, -en or -t: Passive voice examples: The study was funded by Texas Instruments as part of its long-standing commitment to providing leadership in science, technology, engineering and math education. In my previous blog, some highlights of the future of factory automation and how IO-Link is an enabling interface for Industry 4.0 were shared. With an electronic door lock as an example, it will be discussed how features and benefits are added but also shown that the lock should be clever and smart. The active voice is more direct. It clearly establishes a relationship between the subject and action taken. When possible, rearrange sentences so that they are active rather than passive: Active voice examples (revised from those above): Texas Instruments funded the study as part of its long-standing commitment to providing leadership in science, technology, engineering and math education. In my previous blog, I shared some highlights for the future of factory automation and how IO-Link is an enabling interface for Industry 4.0. With an electronic door lock as an example, we will discuss how to add features and benefits to a lock to make it smart. adapter (n) Not adaptor. ADC (n) ADC stands for analog-to-digital converter. Add to cart Add to cart is the call to action on TI.com that when clicked adds a product to the user's shopping cart. Use Add to cart only for devices that have inventory and are available for purchase on TI.com. AEC-Q100 Define AEC on first reference as the Automotive Electronics Council. It's AEC-Q100, not AEC Q-100. aftermarket One word. airflow (n, adj.) all-out (adj.) all-over (adj.) all-purpose (adj.) alpha particle (n), alpha-particle (adj.) Do not say α-particle. alpha ray (n), alpha-ray (adj.) Alternate terms for a device or process controlling another as subordinate Over the past few months TI experts have been in conversation with each other and with various external standards bodies to discuss replacements for antiquated terminology. Here is the guidance as of March 5, 2021 specific to various interfaces, protocols and standards: In the power-converter context: replace master with main and replace slave with subsidiary. (Kripa says we should check with a power-converter SME first, however.) Serial Peripheral Interface: replace master with controller and replace slave with peripheral. (this decision is awaiting IEEE endorsement) I2C interface: replace master with controller and replace slave with target. (this decision is waiting further guidance from MIPI) Controller Area Network (CAN) and Local Area Network (LIN) interface/bus: replace master with commander and replace slave with responder. (this decision was approved by CiA and SAE International) Bluetooth® specification: replace master with central and slave with peripheral. Replace blacklist with reject list and whitelist with accept list. (this decision is final) Alternate terms for a list of blocked or not permitted or allowed or accepted users, websites, emails or applications Use more inclusive language to refer to these list types: • Instead of blacklist, use the term denylist. • Instead of whitelist, use the term allowlist. Follow the guidance recently set forth by the International Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) to drive industry alignment around alternate terms. ammeter (n) Not amperemeter. amplifier (n) Not amp. amplitude-shift keying (n) See "ASK" entry. AMU AMU is an acronym for atomic mass unit. analog-to-digital (adj.) analog-to-digital converter (n) See "ADC" entry. AND (adj.), ANDed (v), ANDing (adj.) AND is an adjective for nouns like "gate." Note the all caps. and I, and me When in doubt about whether to use "and I" or "and me," see whether "I" or "me" sounds correct when the other person is removed from the sentence. Examples: He invited (Deanna and) me to the meeting. He invited (Deanna and) I to the meeting. If you remove "Deanna and" from the sentence, you can see that "He invited I to the meeting" would be incorrect; therefore, "He invited Deanna and I to the meeting" would be incorrect. (Kerry and) I went to the meeting. (Kerry and) me went to the meeting. If you remove "Kerry and" from the sentence, "Me went to the meeting" is incorrect; therefore, "Kerry and me went to the meeting" would be incorrect. and/or Avoid; and/or is not clear because you obviously mean one or the other, or each of these individually, or a combination. Here’s a great way to express and "and/or" construction without using the term at all: Example: For each individual packet, devices may specify the use of encryption at the network layer, the APS layer, neither or both, depending on the required security policy for that specific data. anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) Make magnetoresistance all one word. antenna on package (AoP) Note the lowercase "o" in the acronym for antenna on package. When this phrase stands alone, there are no hyphens: antenna on package. When this phrase is modifying a noun, add hyphens: "A new antenna-on-package design simplifies board manufacturing ..." antialiasing (n, adj.) Not anti-aliasing. AOL AOL is another way to express the open-loop gain. appendix (n, singular), appendixes (n, plural) Not appendices. application See also the "use case" entry. An application is an umbrella term referring to one or more things in the applications hierarchy: market, sector, end-equipment category, end equipment, or subsystem. An application may refer to a collection of end equipment at any level. A reference to a broad market would be "automotive applications." A reference to a general application area within the automotive sector would be "hybrid electric vehicles/electric vehicles." application-specific (adj.) ASET ASET is an acronym for analog single-event transient. ASK (n) ASK stands for amplitude-shift keying. assembly country origin (ACO) The assembly country origin represents the location where assembly occurs. assembly site origin (ASO) The assembly site origin represents the location of an assembly facility, presumably a TI assembly facility. assembly, test and packaging From TI's manufacturing terminology webpage: After the fab process, wafers go to assembly and test factories where chips are assembled into finished semiconductor components, tested to the appropriate specifications, and readied for shipment to our customers. Our internal manufacturing operations also include wafer bump and probe facilities, which are frequently co-located within our existing factories. ASTM ASTM is an acronym for the American Society of Testing and Materials. asynchronous (adj.) Avoid the abbreviation async. ATE ATE is an acronym for automated test equipment. audio frequency (n), audio-frequency (adj.) autoconfiguration (n) autoinitialization (n) autoinitialize (v) autoreference (n, v, adj.) autorepeat (n, v) autosensing (n.) Not auto-sensing or auto sensing, in keeping with autoconfiguration. back annotation (n), back-annotated (adj.) backflow (n, adj.), back flow (v) backlight (n, v) backoff (n, adj.), back off (v) Examples (adj.): binary exponential backoff a backoff procedure backplane (n) backward-compatible (n, adj) Note the hyphen and singular "backward"; not "backwards-compatible." band gap (n), band-gap (adj.) band-limited (adj.) band pass (n), band-pass (adj.) bandwidth (n) barcode (n) baseband (n, adj.) base bar (n) base cell architecture (n) baseline (n, adj.) base station (n) battery-powered (adj.) baud (n) A unit of measure. Not baud rate. BeagleBone Black (n) beamforming (n) All one word. Not beam-forming. beamsteering All one word. Not beam-steering. benchboard (n) bench test (n), bench-test (v, adj.) BiCMOS BiCMOS is an acronym for bipolar complementary metal-oxide semiconductor. Note the lowercase i. bidirectional (adj.) big endian (n), big-endian (adj.) bimodal (adj.) binary-coded decimal (n) Bio-Z Capitalize this term and hyphenate; there is a separate product named BioZ. The Z represents the International Symbol of Units (SI) symbol for impedance (bio impedance). Always add one of these qualifiers after Bio-Z: • testing • test • signal testing • signal test biphase (adj.) bistable (adj.) bit-band (v), bit-banding (n) bit-bang (v), bit-banging (n) bit clock (n), bit-clock (adj.) bit field (n) bitmap (n, v) bitmask (n) bitpool (n) bits, bytes and kilos A lowercase “b” stands for “bit.” An uppercase “B” stands for “byte.” A lowercase “k” stands for “kilo,” meaning 1,000. A capital “K” also stands for “kilo,” but is often used to mean 1,024. Here are the TI standard ways to abbreviate data rates: kb = kilobit KB = kilobyte Mb = megabit MB = megabyte Gb = gigabit GB = gigabyte TB = terabyte To write “per second,” add the lowercase letters “ps” to the data rates above: Mbps, Gbps, and so on. Do not use a space between a value and its unit abbreviation if the unit denotes memory size rather than a unit of measure. If you're interested, Wikipedia has a long history about the confusion that resulted when "early computer scientists used k to mean 1,000" when talking about computer memory. They really meant 2 to the power of 10, which is 1,024. Therefore, use industry-standard style for abbreviations of memory units, as shown in the examples here. Examples: kilobits | 128K bits | 128Kb kilobytes | 128K bytes | 128KB kiloword | 6K word | 6KW megabits | 32M bits | 32Mb megabytes | 32M bytes | 32MB gigabit | 1G bit, 2G bits | 1Gb, 2Gb gigabyte | 1G byte, 2G bytes | 1GB, 2GB bitstream (n) bit-stuff (v) bitwise (adj.) BJT BJT is an acronym for bipolar junction transistor. BL Bitline is an acronym for bitline. Consider whether it's worth making a word that's already only seven characters long into an acronym. bond pad (n) bond-wire (n) Boolean (n, adj.) boot code (n) bootloader (n, adj.) boot load (n, v), boot-load (adj.) bootstrap (n, adj.) boot up (n, v), boot-up (adj.) boundary scan (n), boundary-scan (adj.) BOX BOX is an acronym for buried oxide. BPSG BPSG is an acronym for boron-doped phosphosilicate glass. BQStudio Not bqStudio, BQstudio or BQSTUDIO. Uppercasing BQ represents a change as prescribed by Michael Guillory in an email on March 26, 2019: "To align with other TI businesses, we are migrating to uppercase for product names including BQ. Lowercase nomenclature for BQ was a legacy from a battery management company, Benchmarq, that TI acquired around 1999. While we have many materials that use a lowercase BQ, we need to begin using uppercase moving forward." breadboard (n, v, adj.) breakover (n, adj.) bringup (n), bring up (v), bring-up (adj.) Example (adj.): bring-up process broadband (n, adj.) bufferable (adj.) buildup (n), build up (v) built-in (n, adj.) Not "in-built." This may appear in content because an author has flipped the words, or they may be from Great Britain. burned-in (adj.), burned in (v) burned-up (adj.) burn-in (n, adj.), burn in (v) busbar (n.) Busbar is one word. bus bar (n), bus-bar (adj.) bus holder (n), bus-holder (adj.) bus hold (n), bus-hold (adj.) business, product line, team, group, BU Per TI legal guidelines, we do not refer publicly to various product lines or teams with any sort of entity designator such as "business," "product line," "team," "group," "BU," etc. Reason: We refer publicly to our businesses as our financial segments -- Analog and Embedded. Speaking of more granular parts of the company with such nomenclature can create an expectation from the financial community for us to report financials more granularly than our overall financial segments. byte stack (n), byte-stack (adj.) bytewise (adj., adv.) callback (n, adj.) callout (n, adj.), call out (v) callup (n, adj.), call up (v) camel case or camelCase Camel case, also appropriately spelled CamelCase, is the practice of writing a word with a capital inside it. For example: iPhone CinemaScope VistaVision AstroTurf The name comes from the fact that the uppercase letter makes a “hump” in the word. capacitor (n) Avoid the abbreviation "cap" when referring to a capacitor. capitalizing acronyms Do not capitalize the individual words in the spelled-out version of an acronym unless the words are proper nouns or part of an organization’s name. Examples: digital signal processor (DSP) digital video software development kit (DVSDK) Embedded Processing (EP) Advanced Verification and Validation (AVV) capitalizing job titles Capitalize formal job titles before a name, but lowercase them and set them off with commas after a name. Lowercase informal titles, shortened forms of titles or job descriptions: Examples: TI Chairman, President and CEO Rich Templeton Rich Templeton, TI chairman, president and CEO Annette Rebus, senior wireless silicon design engineer TI engineer Annette Rebus TI Technical Ladder titles are the sole exception, as they are always capitalized. If an employee’s job title is followed by or includes the name of the TI business unit in which they work, the business unit name is capitalized. However, if the title includes the words “business unit,” “group,” or some other common noun further qualifying the team name, those words are lowercase. Example: Tony Leonard, DLP® test development, Product Integration group care-abouts, careabouts Do not use. This word is jargon. Replace with "priorities," "expectations" or "requirements," depending on the context. Incorrect: These careabouts include on-time delivery, configuration control, ship-to-stock and distribution support. Correct: These priorities include on-time delivery, configuration control, ship-to-stock and distribution support. carkit (n, adj.) CAT 5 Short for Category 5, a type of twisted-pair cable. Not CAT5 or CAT-5. It is CAT 5 with a space between CAT and 5 in the Telecommunications Industry Association ANSI/TIA-568 telecommunications standard. cathode-ray tube (n) See "CRT" entry. CCD CCD is an acronym for charge-coupled device. CDP Don't spell out CDP as the Carbon Disclosure Project. The company changed its name several years ago. centigrade (adj.) Use Celsius instead. changeover (n), change over (v) charge-coupled (adj.) chassis (n, singular, plural) Chebyshev (n) Not Tchebysheff. check bit (n) checkbox (n) checklist (n) check off (v) check-off (adj) Do not use checkoff as a noun. It is not used in engineering language as a noun. checkpoint (n) checksheet (n) checksum (n) China New Infrastructure Capitalize China New Infrastructure when using the formal name. Example: “TI is developing localized solutions for the China New Infrastructure initiative, a comprehensive plan to ...” Lowercase when referring to infrastructure in a generic sense: Examples: “Innovating together in new infrastructure” “... collaboration with TI in every area of new infrastructure ..." chip country origin (CCO) The chip country origin represents the location where fabrication occurs. chip select (n), chip-select (adj.) chipset (n) chip site origin (CSO) The chip site origin is the location of the fabrication facility. ciphertext (n) circuit board (n) circuitries (n, plural) CISPR Define as Comité International Spécial des Perturbations Radioélectriques on first reference. citations In the absence of AP guidance for citations, TI turns to IEEE and the Chicago Manual of Style. Both the Associated Press and ANSI recommend using the Chicago Manual of Style for citations. In running text A citation in running text in certain types of TI content consists of a numeral in brackets – for example, [1]. Place this number either after the most relevant information within a sentence or at the end of a sentence. If placing the number at the end of a sentence, the [1] goes before the period ending the sentence. Separate two citations cited in chronological order or three or more citations cited out of chronological order in their own brackets. For example: ... as shown by Brown [4], [5]. ... as shown by Brown [4], [8], [21]. For a range, TI takes slight exception to IEEE. Instead of their recommendation, which is [4]–[9], our style is [4-9]. For the formal References section at the end of certain types of TI content, use the guidance below. If the content type is not contained in this entry, consult the Chicago Manual of Style Citation Quick Guide, which is free and located here: https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html Multiple authors If there are four or more authors, list up to 10 in the bibliography. For more than 10 authors, list the first seven in the bibliography, followed by et al. Embed URLs Do not list website URLs separately. Always embed the URL into the title of the citation, which is better for SEO. Digital object identifier (doi) You can also include a doi at the end of a citation if you wish, but realize that it's very unlikely that 100% of your citations will have dois. And since you're supposed to embed the URL into the title, that's also redundant. Rationale behind exceptions IEEE is not consistent in the punctuation it uses to separate various parts of a citation. For online videos they use periods; for industry standards they use commas. Chicago is more consistent in the use of periods to separate the parts, so for a more harmonious reading experience, TI citations are more likely to follow punctuation as presented in Chicago. Chicago is not consistent in whether or not they put "pp." before page numbers, so any citations that do specify page numbers will take "pp." for consistency. Associated Press style takes precedence over Chicago style in these ways: • Do not use italics ever (for journal names, for example). • Use AP style for month names: spell months out when they stand alone or appear only with a year; abbreviate months six letters or longer when they appear with both a day and a year. Chicago takes precedence over AP style in these ways: • The use of the serial comma in a list of authors. We need it for clarity in long lists of names, some of which are more than two words. Examples: – Kovačević, I., Florian Krismer, Sebastian Schroth, and Johann Walter Kolar. – Wang, Shuo, and Fred C. Lee.

CMOS (n) In our industry, CMOS is an acronym for complementary metal-oxide semiconductor. Within the AP Online Stylebook, CMOS stands for the "Chicago Manual of Style," another style manual. coauthor (n, v) COBOL (n) A computer programming language. codec (n) Not CODEC. In telecommunications, codec is short for coder/decoder. An encoder and decoder, when combined, create a codec. Another meaning is compressor/decompressor, a technology for compressing and decompressing data. coexistence (n) coexistent (adj.) coexist (v) collinear (adj.) collocate (v) Collocate means to place side by side or in a particular location. colocate (v) Colocate to share the same space. Colons in titles or headlines Capitalize the first word after a colon in any kind of title, subtitle or headline. color-coded (v.) common-mode (n, adj.) Example (adj.): common-mode input range companding (n, adj.) compand (v) comparator (n, singular) computationally intensive This is the preferred term over other options such as compute intense, computing intensive or computationally intense. computing Not compute. Avoid using verbs as nouns or adjectives. Conclusion best practices The best conclusion: • Acknowledges that the design challenge exists, but sets the stage for a world where we transcend that design challenge. • Helps engineers imagine what life would look like with their problems solved (with our help; remember, we only help solve). This tactic inspires our readers because they want that imaginary world to be a reality. • Explains what the world looks like with the design challenge conquered – not what the product’s greatest feature is, but its end effect on the people using the application. • For example, if you were discussing TI charger ICs, the conclusion could say, “Charger ICs leveraging USB Type-C™ Power Delivery inputs eliminate the confusion and hassle of having multiple adapters for every device. Consumers will only need to purchase and keep track of one adapter.” • Don’t write a conclusion that restates everything that you just talked about. Always look ahead (where could this technology go?) or provide a new kernel of information. configurability (adj.) connectable (adj.) controlCARD This is a TI product that used to – but no longer – takes a ™ symbol. Follow the capitalization for a similarly named product that is a trademarked name (controlSUITE™). Lowercase the word control and uppercase the word CARD and smush the two words together. When the product is the first word in a sentence, follow AP style for such names and capitalize the letter C. converter From Kristina Atkins on Oct. 2, 2020: I always include “data” before “converter” for two reasons: clarity and SEO. The APP team also has converters – like the DC/DC converters you mentioned, as well as buck converters and boost converters. These products have absolutely nothing to do with data converters, and I’ve always feared that the non-specificity of “converter” could introduce unneeded confusion in our content. So I’ve always avoided it. As for search, “data converter” has a really high search volume, and we want to do everything we can to rank high with keyword relevancy. From a search perspective, using “converter” is kind of like leaving money on the table. converter (n) cooldown (n, adj.), cool down (v) coprime (adj.) coprocessor (n) correlate (v) correlator (n) cosecant (n) See "csc" entry. cosine (n) See "cos" entry. cos (n) cos stands for cosine. cost-effective (adj.) COTS COTS is an acronym for commercial off-the-shelf. Note the hyphens in off-the-shelf. Coulomb counting Coulomb counting is a technique used to track the state of charge of a battery pack. Coulomb is capitalized in all instances because this technique is named after a person, Charles-Augustin de Coulomb. counterclockwise (adj., adv.) country of origin (COO) For general import purposes, the country of origin (COO) is the country/region where an item was produced and/or underwent substantial transformation. COO definition may vary for tariff and tax purposes. coworker (n) crossband (adj.) crossbar (adj.) cross-channel (adj.) crosscheck (n), cross check (v) cross connect (n), crossconnection (n) cross-correlate (v), cross-correlation (n, adj.) cross coupling (n), cross-coupling (adj.) crossfeed (n, adj.) crosshatch (n, v), crosshatching (n, v) cross-index (n, adj. v), cross-indexing (v) cross-reference Always hyphenate. cross scan (n), cross-scan (adj.) cross-section (n., adj.), cross-sectional (adj.) This is an exception to the Associated Press style for cross section as a noun without a hyphen. Always include a hyphen, regardless of the part of speech. crosstalk (n, adj.) CRT (n) CRT stands for cathode-ray tube. csc (n) csc stands for cosecant. cuing (v) Not cueing. current slew rate (di/dt) Measured in A/µs. Define di/dt as current slew rate on first reference. custom-built (adj.) customer-furnished (adj.) customers When addressing your intended audience in TI content, never use the word customers. They might not be a customer yet – so it's presumptuous – and it's also too confusing, because sometimes the context refers to TI's customers and sometimes the context refers to TI's customers' customers (who we would call "users" or "consumers.") Address customers as "you," "designers," "developers" or "engineers." custom-made (adj.) cut-in (n, adj.), cut in (v) cut line (n) cut-on (n, adj.), cut on (v) cutout (n, adj.), cut out (v) cutover (n, adj.), cut over (v) DAC (n) DAC stands for digital-to-analog converter. daisy-chain (n, v) datagram (n) data path (n) data point (n) data set (n) data sheet (n.) Always two words; not datasheet. Hyphenate data sheet when the term modifies a noun: Ex.: data-sheet specifications. A data sheet is a TI technical document that summarizes the performance and other characteristics of a component, subsystem or software. There are two formats for data sheets at TI; the HTML version, which is known as the online data sheet, and the downloadable PDF version. daughterboard (n, adj.) daughtercard (n, adj.) DBU DBU is an acronym for double-bit upset. DC/DC converter (n) DD DD is an acronym for displacement damage. DDD DDD is an acronym for displacement damage dose. deactivate (v) deadband (n., adj.) dead time (n), dead-time (adj.) deassert (v), deassertion (n) debounce (n, v, adj.) decode/decoder You decode (v) with a decoder (n). An encoder and a decoder, when combined, create a codec. Do not capitalize any of these words unless they begin a sentence or are a part of an upstyle title. decouple (v) decrementer (n) DEC-TED DEC-TED is an acronym for double-error correct-triple-error detect. de-emphasis (n, adj.), de-emphasize (v) de-energize (v) degauss (v) deglitch (n, adj.) demo (n.) Try to avoid shortening demonstration to demo, as it may not translate well, and we must write for a global audience. For example, it may be read by ESL speakers as demolition and not demonstration. deprecate, deprecated (v), deprecation (n) derate (v), derating (adj.) desense (n) Design & development Design and development refers to the design resources used specifically during an engineer's design and development cycle, including: • Design tools and simulation. • Hardware development. • Software development. • Reference designs. Only use the ampersand (&) in the phrase "Design & development" in the TI.com navigation tree or section headers. In a regular sentence, use the word "and." Design resources Design resources is the umbrella term for TI deliverables, tools and resources that enable customers to design or develop end equipment with TI products. Design resources include evaluation, simulation, documentation and development tools, including reference designs. The primary navigation menu on TI.com includes a link to design resources. Design tools & simulation Design tools and simulation is a category on TI.com that refers to the resources designers use to create a design, which often include the simulation of how a device will behave under various conditions. This category comprises: • Simulation tools. • Calculation tools. • Circuit designs. • Design tools. • Computer-aided design/computer-aided engineering symbols. • Assembly drawings. • Bill of materials. • Gerber files. • Printed circuit board layouts. • Schematics. Only use the ampersand (&) in the phrase "Design tools & simulation" in the TI.com navigation tree or section headers. In a regular sentence, use the word "and." desolder (v) dialog box (n) dibit (n) dibit stands for binary digit pairs. DICE DICE is an acronym for dual interlocked storage cell. dictionary When you can't find a word or phrase on this site, you'll have to check the dictionary. On May 29, 2024, the Associated Press changed its preferred dictionary from Webster's New World College Dictionary, Fifth Edition, to Merriam-Webster, although this explanation about the change does not give a specific dictionary nor direct users to https://www.merriam-webster.com/. They say this: "We are making our first change in our primary dictionary in decades, now turning to Merriam-Webster as our first source. We don't take such a switch lightly, as AP style is informed by the spelling and styling recommended by our main dictionary. In recent years, we have seen that Merriam-Webster is more up to date and more in line with our approach. In making the change to our new primary dictionary, we carefully compared our guidance with Merriam-Webster's. We believe that a stylebook is different from a dictionary, and in doing this comparison, we eliminated many terms already listed in Merriam-Webster. We believe strongly that writers and editors need both a stylebook and a dictionary, so we recommend you use your AP Stylebook in concert with the Merriam-Webster dictionary for the most complete guidance." dielectric (n, adj.) differentiates, differentiated, differentiation In marketing, product differentiation is the modification of a product or offering to make it more attractive to a particular market. This effort involves differentiating the product from competitors' products as well as one's own offerings. Example: An integrated, delayed microprocessor-reset function differentiates TPS73xx low-dropout regulators (LDOs) fromTPS71xx and TPS72xx LDOs. digipots You can abbreviate digital potentiometers to digipots on first reference (treat it like an acronym and put it in parentheses) and then call it digipots on subsequent references. Do not abbreviate to “digi-pots” or “digitPOTs.” digital-to-analog (adj.) digital-to-analog converter (n) See "DAC" entry. DIN automotive standard DIN stands for Deutsches Institut für Normung, which in English means German Institute for Standardisation. But in keeping with our style for CISPR, where we use the French, you define DIN on first reference as Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN). DIP (n) DIP stands for dual in-line package. direct-connect (adj.), direct-connected (adj.) direct-couple (v), direct-coupled (adj.) DMR DMR is an acronym for dual-modular redundant. Doppler shift (n) double-digit (adj.) double-pole double-throw (adj.) double time (n), double-time (v, adj.) doubleword (n, adj.) downconversion (n, adj.), downconvert (v), downconverter (n) download (n, v) downsampling (n) downstyle When applying downstyle, also known as sentence style or headline style, capitalize only the first word and proper nouns. Eye-tracking studies prove that downstyle positively influences readability and clicking behavior because readers can scan and absorb text quickly. Downstyle appropriately emphasizes TI brand names (which are proper nouns), and many engineering schools’ writing standards today teach students to minimize capitalization. Example: Broadcast: TI CEO focuses remarks on priorities, strategy Do not capitalize the second part of a hyphenated word in a downstyle title unless it’s a proper noun. See "life" below: Example: Work-life balance key to TI’s inclusion in Fortune magazine list Do not capitalize the first word in a downstyle title if it appears after a TI device number or a measurement. A device number or a measurement do actually qualify as the first word. Apply downstyle (capitalizing only the first word and proper nouns in headlines, titles and subtitles) to these content types. All subheadings, figure labels and text in tables for these content types should be downstyle. • Analog Design Journal articles • Banner ads • Blog posts • Conference presentations • Contributed articles • Copy on banners • Email subject lines • Infolink stories • News releases • Presentation titles and headings and content on slides • The product features and description (FAD) on TI.com product folders • Reference design titles and descriptions • Social media posts (except text on graphics, which may be all capital letters for readability in a small size) • Technical articles (short articles on the TI E2E™ support forums formerly known as blog posts) • TI.com navigation, page titles and on-page text • Trade show graphics • Training materials • Videos If the content type is not listed above, contact charmaine@ti.com to add it to this list. In the interim, downstyle takes precedence in the absence of official guidance. downstyle headline wrapping If a downstyle headline is so long that it wraps to a second line or more, do not capitalize the first word of the second line. Example: Leading the way: TI overhauls Finance Development Program to meet younger workers' needs downtime (n) DRAM DRAM is an acronym for dynamic random access memory. driver assistance Not driver assist. Avoid using verbs as nouns. drop-off (n), drop off (v) DSET DSET is an acronym for digital single-event transient. DTI DTI is an acronym for deep trench isolation. dual-access RAM (n) You do not have to spell out RAM on first reference. See "RAM" entry. dual in-line package (n) See "DIP" entry. dual port (n.), dual-port (adj.) Hyphenate dual-port when it modifies a noun like "controller." duplexer (n) DUT DUT is an acronym for device under test. duty cycle (n), duty-cycle (adj.) earthbound (adj.) e-beam (n, adj.) ECC ECC is an acronym for error correction circuit. edge computing Not edge compute. Approved by the Embedded Processing team on Dec. 15, 2020. eDMA (n) eDMA stands for enhanced direct memory access. Do not use EDMA. efficacy (n) eFuse (n) An eFuse is an active circuit-protection device with an integrated field-effect transistor used to limit currents and voltages to safe levels during fault conditions. e-h e-h is an an abbreviation of the term electron hole. ELDRS ELDRS is an acronym for enhanced low-dose-rate sensitivity. electrochemical (n, adj.) electromagnetic interference (EMI) or electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) "performance" Avoid describing EMI as “performance,” especially with a positive adjective like “great,” unless you are specifically describing in the same sentence the testing of EMI for a standard (like CISPR). Because EMI is bad, describing it in positive terms gets confusing when we translate TI content into other languages. Remember that both acronyms end with nouns: interference and compatibility. There often isn't a need to further qualify either term. The objectives in TI content are usually to minimize or mitigate EMI and ensure EMC. electro-magnet (n), electromagnetic (adj.) electromechanical (adj.) electronics (singular noun) electro-optical (adj.) electrostatic (adj.) emitter-follower (n, adj.) EMP EMP is an acronym for electromagnetic pulse. encode/encoder You encode (v) with an encoder (n). An encoder and a decoder, when combined, create a codec. Do not capitalize any of these words unless they begin a sentence or are a part of an upstyle title. end equipment (n), end-equipment (adj.) End equipment refers to the final product that a TI customer creates using TI products. End equipment always comprises multiple subsystems. Examples of end equipment include a gas detector or a powertrain current sensor. end-equipment page An end-equipment page is a page on TI.com that provides information about end equipment supported by TI products. Do not use the term "EEQ folder" in any external content. That is only a term used internally. When linking to an end-equipment page, use "end equipment" in the hyperlink. When linking to a subsystem within an end-equipment page, use "end-equipment subsystem" in the hyperlink. endian (adj.), endianness (n) end-point (n, adj.) end product (n), end-product (adj.) entropic (adj.), entropy (n) epicycle (n) epitaxial (adj.) e- prefix Use a hyphen with e- terms: e-book, e-reader, e-commerce, e-meter. Capitalize the "e" if the word is the first word of a sentence. ESA ESA is an acronym for the European Space Agency. ESCC ESCC is an acronym for European Space Components Coordination. Ethernet (n) Note the capital E. European and Asian style for dates Avoid 5/6/19 and similar formats for writing dates because of the confusion that can result between the American (May 6) and European (June 5) approaches to day and month order. May 5, 2019, and 5 May 2019 are both acceptable depending on where the audience resides. Do not set off European-constructed dates with commas or periods. European audience examples: The London conference will take place 19 Dec. The project’s 31 Jan 2014 deadline could not be extended. Asian audience examples: Asia: Year, Month and Date China: 2019年10月10日（2019 October 10） Korean: 2019년 10월 10일 Traditional Chinese (Taiwan): 2019年10月10日 EV charging levels The Society of Automotive Engineers outlines three levels of EV charging: Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. ever-increasing (adj.) EVM EVM is an acronym that TI seems to use exclusively, rather than being an industry term. Thus, do not use the acronym EVM in a title or subtitle. It is OK to use the acronym "EVM" in regular text, defining as evaluation module on first reference. exceptions to spelling out numbers below 10 Always use numerals with currency, percentages, ratios, dimensions, proportions, sizes, speeds, and millions and billions. Also, follow AP's rule to use numerals in listicle titles for technical articles or contributed articles only, not reference design titles nor device descriptions. Examples: $1.10 (1,000-unit price), $0.73 (1,000-unit price) A $1 million grant Reduce bill-of-materials costs by 20% A duty-cycle range of 0% to 50% 16:9 aspect ratio 100,000-1 contrast ratio A 329-pin, 0.65-mm-pitch ball-grid array package Constructed just 6 miles away The resulting display showed the number 6 Exceeding 10 million bits per second 5 ways high-performance MCUs are reshaping the industry exclusive-OR (adj.) expandor (n) faceplate (n) fail-safe (n, adj.) falloff (n), fall off (v) fall time (n) family, subfamily On 5/12/23, from Gloria Lee: Just a heads up that a request from Jill had prompted the TI.com team to look into the use of “subfamily/family” language. The conclusion is that this is an internal TI term and not as relevant to customers. It also doesn’t translate well. Instead, use language like product series, portfolio or category. fan-in (n, adj.) fan-out (n, adj.) fastest, smallest, best, the industry’s first, the only, leading, industry-leading Avoid these terms. China has a law that bans the use of words like “first,” “highest” and “best” in advertisements, with fines ranging from $30,000 to $160,000. Replace with: one of the … (fastest, smallest, best, the industry’s, the only, leading) or among the … (fastest, smallest, best, the industry’s, the only, leading) or a fact about the product or offering you’re describing fast Fourier transform Note the capital F. See "FFT" entry. fault-finding (adj.) fault-free (adj.) fault-sensing (adj.) feedforward (n, adj.), feed forward (v) feedthrough (n, adj.), feed through (v) FET (n) FET is an acronym for field-effect transistor. FFT (n) FFT stands for fast Fourier transform. fieldbus (n.) Not field bus. field-effect transistor (n) See "FET" entry. FIFO (n) FIFO stands for first-in, first-out. file name Not filename. file names, commands and computer buttons Technical Documentation and Digital Marketing agreed to this rule in December 2021. Place the unique names of files, commands or buttons in boldface, not quotation marks, underline or italics. Match your treatment of the name with its original source in the hardware or software or on the web. This is particularly important for file names. If it is not possible to verify the original source, then use downstyle capitalization for commands, icon names, keyboard names or button names. The boldface will serve as enough of a visual distinction so that you can use downstyle. If it is not possible to verify a file name (which would be extremely unusual), use upstyle capitalization. See the Microsoft Manual of Style for more information and many more examples: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/procedures-instructions/formatting-text-in-instructions Examples: Click File and select Save as (or Save As if that is the capitalization of the button or menu name). Open the MyTaxesFor2016 file. Click Extract. To log out of the scheduling tool, either close the browser or select Sign out (or Sign Out if that is the capitalization of the button or menu name). fine-tune (v), fine-tuning (n) first-in, first-out (n) See "FIFO" entry. FIT FIT is an acronym for failures in time. fixed-price (adj.) flash memory (n) Lowercase.

GmbH (n) The acronym GmbH, which is written after the name of a German company, designates it as a private entity. The letters stand for Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, which translated literally means a company with limited liability. go-ahead (n, adj.) go, no-go (n, v, adj.) GPN, OPN, part, part number, device, product, integrated circuit, chip, component TI has guidelines regarding the use of these terms to refer to what we manufacture and sell. Within TI.com tables, components, functions and standard page elements: • Use “product” for the generic product number (GPN). • Use “orderable number” for the orderable part number (OPN). A GPN (product) will contain multiple OPNs (parts). • Use "part number" when referencing specific OPNs that customers can order. • "Parts" is an acceptable alternative if you are referencing a general collection of OPNs, but if you are referring to a specific individual OPN or a collection of OPNs, use "part number" for clarity and consistency. • If you are referencing a collection of devices that can include both GPNs and OPNs, such as for search boxes on TI.com where you can enter a GPN or OPN, use the part nomenclature. Within marketing and high-level content such as news releases, marketing messaging, articles, blogs and white papers: • Use the noun that describes the device in its title on the product page or data sheet: controller, converter, microcontroller, regulator, sensor, battery charger, supervisor. • While sometimes “part” is the best word, even in marketing content, try to avoid this term in favor of "device," "product," "integrated circuit" or "chip." (Avoid using the word "device" after the word "analog" because Analog Devices is a competitor.) The reason is that in these content types, “part” sounds simplistic and easily interchangeable with others vs. our innovative, unique or complex technology. It is also a reference to OPNs. • Use the word "component" to indicate only external circuitry that customers need to add to design their applications with our devices. Do not use the word component when referring to a TI product. Be specific and follow the guidance in the first bulleted item in this list: say resistors or capacitors instead, for example. grammatical person (first person I/we/our; second person you; third person they/employees/TI) You may wonder whether it’s correct to write your communication in the first person plural (we/our), the second person (you) or the third person (they/employees/the company). See the TI brand voice guidelines for more information, but in general: • Write blog posts, contributed articles and white papers using the first person "I," or "we" if the content has more than one author. • In communications meant for TI customers, the second person "you" is more direct and dynamic; it helps readers immediately envision themselves doing the action you describe. AP says only that choosing a grammatical person “probably depends on your target audience. To vary expression, a mixture might work, too.” Be consistent in the construction; do not mix different grammatical persons and possessive pronouns within the same sentence. In other words, don’t decide on a formal tone and then address the audience informally. Incorrect: Designers can order samples of LMS4895 device online today; request your evaluation module (EVM) online today and download software via www.TI.com. Correct: TI unveiled its initial list of global authorized software providers today. Within our SBE, we are focused on improving our execution every day. grayscale (n, adj.) GSO GSO is an acronym for geosynchronous orbit. GT/s GT/s stands for gigatransfers per second, part of the PCIe specification. half-adder (n) half-cycle (n) half-life (n) halftime (n) halfway (adj.) halfword (n, adj.) Hall effect (n) Note the capital H and lowercase e. Hall-effect sensor (n.) This sensor type is named after a physicist named Edwin Hall; therefore, always capitalize the word Hall. Also include "-effect" rather than simply saying a "Hall sensor." handbook (n) handoff (n, adj.), hand off (v) handshake (n, adj.) hangup (n), hang up (v) hard copy (n) hard-disk system (n) hardware (n) Do not abbreviate to HW. hardware page A hardware page is a page on TI.com that provides information about TI hardware. Do not use the terms "hardware folder" or "tool folder" in any external content. Those are only internal terms. hardwire (v), hardwired (adj.) HDR HDR is an acronym for high dose rate. headend (n) Example (n): A cable headend receives various signals. headway (n) heat sink (n) Not heatsink. heat-treat (v), heat-treating (adj.) heavy-duty (adj.) henry (n, singular), henrys (n, plural) HEO HEO is an acronym for high Earth orbit. hermetically sealed (adj.) high-frequency (adj.) high impedance (n), high-impedance (adj.) high-order (adj.) high-pass (adj.) high-speed (adj.)

According to Strunk and White, "The word usually serves better when not in first position." AVOID: The roads were almost impassable. However, we at last succeeded in reaching camp. PREFERRED: The roads were almost impassable. At last, however, we succeeded in reaching camp. How to create a bullet point The preferred way to create a bullet point at TI in Microsoft Word is to click the Bullets button, which you’ll find in the Home tab of the ribbon. Next, left-justify the bullet list (in other words, undo the automatic indentation) by highlighting the bulleted list and clicking the Decrease Indent button, also found in the Home tab of the ribbon, until the bullet list is fully left-justified. If you are creating content in a program other than Microsoft Word, you can insert bullets choosing Insert > Symbol (or a similar command) and selecting the round bullet from the Symbol font options. Bullets should be the same size as the text, never larger. Keep the bullet fully left-justified and insert one space before the first word of the bulleted sentence or phrase. how to write a sentence with an embedded hyperlink to TI content For the best search engine optimization, always embed the hyperlink to TI content into the title of the data sheet, training video, web page, application note, and so on. The most common verb that we use at TI to direct readers to content is "see" – not "click," "go to" or "visit." You can also use "check out," "read" or "download" for the call-to-action verb. Do not use words like "here" and embed the hyperlink into that word. People don't search for the word here. They may search for words that are in the content title. Example: For more information, see the ADJ article, “Improve Power Density with a Baby Boost Converter in a PFC Circuit.” The Motor Drives overview page includes links to reference designs related to motor drives. hung-up (adj.), hung up (v) hypercube (n) hysteresis (n), hysteretic (adj.) I2C I2C is an abbreviation for Inter-Integrated Circuit, a type of bus designed by Philips Semiconductors in the early 1980s. Inter-Integrated Circuit is capitalized because we capitalize the names of all standards, interfaces and protocols, and I2C is an interface. In general, the proper TI style for the I2C interface is to superscript the 2. The context is important, however. In a table from Tech Docs' Writing and Editing Standards PDF, they make a distinction as to whether or not to superscript the 2 based on the descriptive noun. If the descriptive noun is module, pin, register or signal, do not superscript the 2 in I2C. This is because of a convention within Tech Docs to uppercase the names of modules, pins, registers or signals. POWERGOOD and PGOOD are other examples of pin names, for example. If the descriptive noun is bus, device, interface, mode or subsystem, superscript the 2 in I2C. There are places on TI.com that cannot process the superscripted 2. When you try subscripting or superscripting letters in a product description (which has a limit of 100 characters), you have to count the code as characters. “<sup>2</sup>” adds another 11 characters. Another option is to use “the UNICODE ². IC IC is an acronym for integrated circuit. ideal Referring to a TI device as "ideal" for certain applications can be legally problematic because such statements can be viewed as creating implied warranties for the suitability of a device in an application, according to the TI Legal Department. TI specifically disclaims such implied warranties, and it's prudent to avoid statements that could expose TI to increased liability. It's ultimately customers' responsibility to determine whether a TI device is right for an application, and so you should avoid words such as "ideal" when describing TI products. Among the alternatives: 1. With their consent, you can quote TI customers who have indicated that TI parts are a good fit for specific applications. 2. If you can't provide a quote but could demonstrate that a statement is true if pressed to do so, you can say that TI customers have chosen these TI parts for similar applications and have reported positive results. (Of course you shouldn't cite customer names unless you have permission.) 3. You can cite figures concerning customers' use of certain TI devices for certain applications (or for applications involving similar conditions). Here are some other options to consider that state the concept in more objective terms about TI’s intent with the product, or that clearly state the customer as the decision-maker: Objective terms: is designed for is optimized for offers benefits for Benefits (as a verb) Customer decides: Many engineers choose Meets the xxx design challenge can enable can provide IEEE Define on first reference as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. IGBT IGBT is an acronym for insulated gate bipolar transistor. impedance-matching (adj.) inclusive OR operator (n, adj.) indeterministic (adj.) indexes (n, plural), indices (n, plural in certain math expressions) inductor (n) inertial (adj.) in-house (adj.) inline (n), in-line (adj.) innovative Avoid this word. We use it so often that we have diminished its meaning such that if everything TI makes is innovative, nothing that the company makes is innovative (right?). The 2008 TI Brand Book lists these terms as alternatives to innovative: • Inventive • Ingenious • Fresh • New (watch out for this – see the FTC new entry) • Remarkable • Creative • Advanced • Visionary • Courageous • Open-minded • Genius • Challenging • A step ahead in-place (adj.) inrush (adj.) Do not hyphenate and use only as an adjective. instrument cluster (n.) Not just "cluster." Add instrument. The plural of instrument cluster is instrument clusters. interchangeable (adj.) Internet of Things/IoT Uppercase "Internet" and "Things" when using this term. The acronym for the term Internet of Things is IoT, not IOT. interoperate (v) interprocessor (n) intrados (n, plural) intraprocessor (n) inverter (n) IPROPI pin IPROPI is an acronym for current proportional to current. is commonly used This is a passive-voice construction. Consider revising to an alternative term like "popular." isometric (adj.), isometrics (n) joule (n) A unit of energy. jump-start (n, v) keep-alive (adj.) keep-out (adj.), keep out (v) key fob The term key fob is two words according to AP's preferred dictionary, Merriam-Webster (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fob) – not keyfob. keypad (n) keystroke (n) keyword (n) kickback (n, adj.) kick-start (n, v) kilosamples per second (kSPS), megasamples per second (MSPS) It's kSPS with a lowercase k because that's the traditional representation for kilo. But megasamples per second takes a capital M: MSPS. label (n, v), labeled (v, adj.), labeling (v) lane-keeping assistance Not lane-keep assist. Avoid using verbs as nouns. Laplace transform (n) large-scale (adj.) latch-up (n, adj.), latch up (v) lateral-overflow-drain antiblooming device layoff (n, adj.), lay off (v) layout (n, adj.), lay out (v) LCD LCD is the acronym for liquid crystal display. You do not need to spell it out on first reference. See the "abbreviations and acronyms" entry. LDR LDR is an acronym for low dose rate. leadframe (n) lead-free Use lead-free on first reference and Pb-free in subsequent references. These terms refer to semiconductor products that are compliant with European Union regulations regarding the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), including the requirement that lead not exceed 0.1% of the weight of homogeneous materials. lead-in (n) lead time (n); lead-time (adj.) Examples of modifier use: lead-time limit, lead-time sequence. lead (v, present tense of led), lead (n, meaning the element) In electronics, a lead is an electrical connection consisting of a length of wire or a metal pad designed to connect two locations electrically. Lead is also a chemical element with the symbol Pb. least significant (adj.) LED (n, singular), LEDs (n, plural) LED is an acronym for light-emitting diode. You do not need to spell it out on first reference. See the note in the "abbreviations and acronyms" entry. led (v, past tense of lead) lens (n, singluar), lenses (n, plural) LEO LEO is an acronym for low Earth orbit. LET LET is an acronym for linear energy transfer. letdown (n, adj.), let down (v) letter-quality (adj.) letup (n, adj.), let up (v) leveled (v, adj.), leveling (v) level shift (v) license (n) Not licence. life cycle (n), life-cycle (adj.) Hyphenating life cycle as an adjective is an exception to the New World College Dictionary. light-emitting diode (n) See "LED" entry. like, such as Use "like" only when making a comparison, not to illustrate an example. Incorrect example: The introduction of high-efficiency isolated power modules like the UCC12050 from TI, which uses integrated magnetics for reduced EMI, will go hand in hand to enable high-density solutions like GaN. Correct example: The system behaves essentially like a black box, as there is no a priori knowledge of its inner workings. Use "such as" to list examples. Correct example: The introduction of high-efficiency isolated power modules such as the UCC12050 from TI, which uses integrated magnetics for reduced EMI, will go hand in hand to enable high-density solutions such as GaN. line-replaceable (adj.) lineup (n), line up (v) line width (n) links-to-layout (n, adj.) liquid crystal display (n) See "LCD" entry. LISP (n) An abbreviation for list programming. lithium-ion The Associated Press does not capitalize the names of elements. Always lowercase lithium-ion unless it begins a sentence or is the first word in a downstyle title or a word in an upstyle title. You can use the shortened term "Li-ion" (with a capital L) on subsequent references. See second example below. Example if the TI content only mentions lithium-ion one time: This translates into potentially 100 or more lithium-ion cells stacked together in series inside the vehicle chassis. Example if the TI content will have more than one reference to lithium-ion: (First time it's mentioned) With lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries found in both small electronic devices and much larger applications, they naturally span a wide range of sizes, voltages and form factors. (Second time it's mentioned) After the cell assembly process, each Li-ion battery goes through gradual charging, during which it forms a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, which is critical for its long-term functionality. lithium polymer Always lowercase lithium polymer unless it begins a sentence or is the first word in a downstyle title or a word in an upstyle title. Unlike lithium-ion, do not hyphenate lithium polymer if it is not modifying a noun. You can use the shortened term "li-polymer" (with a lowercase L) on subsequent references. little endian (n), little-endian (adj.) lock-on (n, adj.), lock on (v) lockout (n, adj.), lock out (v) lockstep (adj.) lockup (n), lock up (v) LOCOS LOCOS is an acronym for local oxidation of silicon. logout (n), log out (v) longnose (adj.) long-range (adj.) long run (n) longwave (n, adj.) lookdown (n), look down (v) look-in (n, adj.), look in (v) lookthrough (n, adj.) look-up (n, adj.), look up (v) look-up table (n) loopback (n, v) lossy (adj.) louver (n) low-dropout (LDO) linear regulator There are low-dropout regulators (LDO); there are linear regulators; and there are low-dropout linear regulators. Engineers will tend to use LDO by itself as shorthand. So when you see LDO in content, you must add the word "regulator" after it. low-frequency (adj.) low-level (adj.) low-lying (adj.) low-noise (adj.) low-pass (adj.) low-power (adj.) low-pressure (adj.) low-volume (adj.) LV automotive standard LV stands for Liefervorschriften. It's a standard created by German automakers.

No hyphen. man-machine (n, adj.) Consider saying person-machine. manufactures A very common typo for manufacturers that spell check won't catch. Manufacturing capability From TI's manufacturing terminology webpage: Owning and controlling our manufacturing operations allow us to provide geopolitically dependable capacity to our customers around the world. With our internal manufacturing capabilities, we’re able to source more than 85% of our manufacturing flows and technologies at more than one site, quickly bring factories online and streamline product qualifications – all while adhering to strict quality specifications. Additionally, our business continuity processes help us limit the interruption of production caused by unexpected events. man-year (n, adj.), man-month (n, adj.), man-hour (n, adj.) Consider saying person-year, person-month or person-hour. markets Lowercase the names of markets, as they are common, generic nouns or noun phrases. Here are the most commonly used market names: • automotive • industrial • enterprise • personal electronics • communications equipment You can also refer to these categories as "applications" in TI marketing content, in the context that we make products for these applications. markoff (n, adj.), mark off (v) Markov chain (n) markup (n, adj.), mark up (v) mass-produce (v), mass-produced (adj.), mass production (n) material (n, meaning matter or substance), materiel (n, meaning military equipment) matrix (n, singular), matrices (n, plural) maxwell (n) A unit of measure. MBU MBU is an acronym for multiple-bit upset. McASP (n) McASP stands for multichannel audio serial port. meal time between failure (n), mean-time-between-failures (adj.) See "MTBF" entry. mean time (n, in math or astronomy), meantime (n), mean-time (adj.) mean time to repair (n), mean-time-to-repair (adj.) megacell (n) Megamodule (n) Not MegaModule. megapixel (MP) TI takes exception to the two Ask the Editor questions in the AP Stylebook that state you should spell out megapixels when used with a number. Treat megapixels the same way as other measurements such as amperes or megahertz; spell out the word when the word doesn't appear with a number, but abbreviate it when it does appear with a number. Examples: A 2-MP imager The reference design has a camera module that's 8.3 MP Build once and deploy multichannel products such as a megapixel-embedded network video recorder megohmmeter (n) MEMS MEMS stands for micro-electro mechanical system. MEO MEO is an acronym for medium Earth orbit. metal-oxide semiconductor (n) metrology (n) mho (n) Reciprocal of an ohm. Obsolete; do not use. Use siemens instead. microammeter (n) microcontroller (n) micro-electro mechanical See MEMS. We are honoring Digital Documentation's preference for the placement of hyphens and spaces in this term, having previously made microelectromechanical all one word. microhenry (n) microhm (n) micrometer (n) micromicrosecond (n) Do not use. Use picosecond instead. microprogrammable (adj.) microswitch (n) midscale (adj.) milestone (n, adj.) millihenry (n) milli-inch (n) millimeter wave (mmWave) Do not use mmWave without first defining it as millimeter wave. Hyphenate if the phrase modifies a noun: millimeter-wave technology. Do not hyphenate the phrase if it stands alone: Another sensing technology is millimeter wave. mil (n) A wire diameter measure, angular measure or unit of length. MIL-STD MIL-STD is an abbreviation for military standard. misconfigure (v) mission See the "passion" entry. mnemonic (n, adj.) mockup (n, adj.), mock up (v) money Don't use extra zeros (.00) with sums of money: Examples: The C6424 EVM, priced at $495, is available today. The GC5316 costs $165 in 1,000-unit quantities. monochromator (n) monopulse (n) More than, greater than, less than, over, under, beyond, past To avoid ambiguity, say: • "More than," "greater than," and "less than" to describe numbers and measurable amounts. • "Over" and "under" to describe a position in space. Beyond is a preposition that means "past, farther than, or outside of." Do not use "past" to refer to a measurement. Past is a preposition that means beyond in position or time. Example: Adding the new module pushes the power consumption beyond the limit and trips the breaker. MOS MOS is an acronym for metal-oxide semiconductor. MOSFET, DMOSFET MOSFET is an acronym for metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor. DMOSFET is an acronym for double-diffused metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor. most significant (adj.) motherboard (n., adj.) motor-driven (adj.) movable (n, adj.) move-out (adj.), move out (v) MTBF MTBF stands for mean time between failure. multiplexer (mux) (n.)/demultiplexer (demux) (n.) The abbreviation for multiplexer is mux and the abbreviation for demultiplexer is demux. Because these shortened forms are abbreviations and not acronyms, do not capitalize mux or demux. multiplication symbol Use the multiplication symbol (×) rather than the keyboard x or an asterisk in projector screen dimensions and equations. As illustrated in the package types and package dimensions entry, use the word "by" in regular sentences (3 mm by 3 mm) and the multiplication symbol (×) in tables or space-constrained text. NACK (n), NACKed (v), NAK (v) NAND (adj.), NAND (n, v), NANDed (v) narrowband (n, adj.) N-channel (n) ND/PD ND/PD is an acronym for neutron dose/proton dose. negative-going (adj.) negative numbers Use an en dash to indicate the negative sign for a negative number, in order to align with Technical Documentation style. Example: The TMP112 has an operating temperature range of –40°C to 125°C. net 30 terms Not net30 terms or Net 30 terms or net-30 terms. netlist (n, adj.) next-generation (adj.) nHD nHD stands for ninth high definition, meaning a screen resolution of 640 x 360 pixels, which is one-ninth the total number of pixels in the full HD (FHD) standard (1920 x 1080). nibble (n) A half byte. NIEL NIEL is an acronym for nonionizing energy loss. NMOS NMOS is an acronym for N-channel metal-oxide semiconductor. no-bid (n, v, adj.) no-burst (adj.) nonce (n) NOR (adj.), NOR (n, v), NORed (v) Example (adj.): NOR gate noun strings, commas in TI product descriptions Avoid long noun strings. Incorrect example: Now, find the glare screen bracket peg adjuster screw. Correct example: Now, find the screw that adjusts the bracket peg for the glare screen. In TI product descriptions, for clarity and easy translation, minimize the number of adjectives in noun phrases. Pick only one or two of the most important qualities or features when initially describing a TI product. If that's not possible, use the guidance from the AP Stylebook "commas" entry; see the section titled "with equal adjectives": Use commas to separate a series of adjectives equal in rank. If the commas could be replaced by the word “and” without changing the sense, the adjectives are equal: Example: A high-performance, quad-channel ADC Do not use a comma when the last adjective before a noun outranks its predecessors. It is an integral element of a noun phrase, which is the equivalent of a single noun: Examples: Multichannel signal-acquisition systems A new low-power RF network protocol 5.5-A, 36-V 400-kHz synchronous step-down converter 5-A/5-A 3-kVRMS single-channel isolated gate driver with Miller clamp Consider putting feature descriptors before the component name and peripheral descriptors after (using the words with or for). See also this Ask the Editor question: In the sentence "We invest in high-quality, single-tenant, operationally essential real estate with long-term net leases." With the three descriptors for the noun "real estate" would you delete the final comma and insert "and" instead or leave as is? ANSWER I'd leave it as is. We generally aim to limit our use of commas, which might argue for deleting this one and inserting "and." However, in this case the comma provides a pause that helps the reader keep track. An "and" would make the sentence rather breathless. Also: Consider whether "operationally essential" is clear to your audience. Without further guidance from AP, at TI, it's important to determine how many descriptors before the final product name still read fluidly without commas, while inserting commas if the string gets too long to serve as pauses (as described above) and to give readers a chance to absorb the descriptors separately. The current decision is: • Do not include commas in descriptions that include three or fewer descriptors. • Use commas in descriptions with four or more descriptors, but only between the third and fourth descriptor, fourth and fifth descriptor, etc. Examples: • Three or fewer descriptors: “Two-channel simultaneous-sampling SAR ADC with single-ended inputs” • More than three descriptors: “16-bit, 1-MSPS, two-channel simultaneous-sampling SAR ADC with single-ended inputs” Note that commas are not included between “two-channel simultaneous-sampling SAR” because those are the first three descriptors for the ADC, but they are included between 16-bit and 1-MSPS because those are the fourth and fifth descriptors. "Three or fewer” may seem arbitrary. It could be one descriptor, but then the second example above would say: 16-bit, 1-MSPS, two-channel, simultaneous-sampling, SAR ADC with single-ended inputs which sounds rather staccato. NPN NPN is an acronym for N-channel P-channel N-channel. NPN, PNP (adj.) NPN stands for negative-positive-negative, not N-channel P-channel N-channel. PNP stands for positive-negative-positive, not P-channel N-channel P-channel. nth As in, "to the nth degree." As italics are against Associated Press style, do not italicize the "n" in "nth." numbered lists Do not number lists unless the steps must be completed in a specific order. Use bullets instead, following the guidance in this entry: https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/lists-bulleted-lists Do not use numbered lists in regular sentences (also known as running text). Incorrect example: The three main characteristics that differentiate the types of LANs are (1) media, (2) topology and (3) protocols. Correct example: The three main characteristics that differentiate the types of LANs are media, topology and protocols. See this Ask the Editor question: https://www.apstylebook.com/ask_the_editors/37747 number ranges Use the word “to” between two values in a range of numbers. Only use a hyphen when there are space constraints. Include the unit of measure for each number, not just the second one. Example in regular text: The C64™ DSP core provides 20% to 30% higher code density. A DAC for 4mA to 20mA current-loop applications. Example in web banner (space constrained): The C64™ DSP core provides 20-30% higher code density. A DAC for 4mA-20mA current-loop applications. Never use a hyphen to identify a range that contains two negative values; only use "to." Example: The pullup current ranges from –18µA to -25µA. If a range has a negative and a positive value, use a en-dash to represent the negative value and a plus sign to represent the positive value. Example: Input voltage range: –0.3V to +6V Operative temperature range: -40°C to +125°C. If providing a specific value with a number, do not also use "typically," "generally" or "approximately." We never want our customers to feel that TI is uncertain about the values we provide. Incorrect example (avoid when possible): The current is limited to 2µA typically. When possible, refer to values by their specific electrical parameter name (such as "input voltage") rather than a number in data sheets. When using a specific parameter name, you can then include "minimum," "typical" or "maximum" as needed. Incorrect example (in a data sheet): Do not exceed 36V. Correct example: Do not exceed the maximum input voltage. The current is limited to the typical input voltage. numbers at the beginning of a sentence Spell out a number at the beginning of a sentence. Example: Forty years ago, TI invented the electronic handheld calculator. Consider revising the sentence if spelling out the number is awkward. Instead of: Eight thousand 16-bit MMACs can occur every second. Revise to: These DSPs can process 8,000 16-bit MMACS per second. EXCEPTION A numeral that identifies a calendar year: 1930 is the year that J. Clarence Karcher and Eugene McDermott founded Texas Instruments, originally named Geophysical Service Inc. numerals more than three digits long In numerals greater than 999, U.S. usage calls for commas to set off each group of three numerals (except for years): Examples: 5,250 10,000 375,000 oersted (a unit of measurement) An oersted is a centimeter-gram-second unit of magnetic field strength. It is named after Hans Christian Oersted. But as with every International System of Unit (SI) unit named for a person, its symbol starts with an upper case letter (O), but when written in full it follows the rules for capitalization of a common noun. Thus, capitalize "oersted" at the beginning of a sentence and in upstyle titles, but lowercase in downstyle titles and in a regular sentence. off-board (adj.) off-center (adj.) off-chip (adj.) offload (v) off-the-shelf (adj.) ohmmeter (n) Not ohm-ammeter. on-chip (n, adj.) one's complement (n), 1's complement (n), one's-complement (adj.), 1's-complement (adj.) ongoing (adv.) on-state resistance (n) on the fly Avoid this idiom, which will not translate properly. Use the context to come up with a suitable revision. For example, "in real time," "quickly" or "simultaneously" may work. on the market Avoid saying "in the market." A TI product or a product that includes TI devices is "on the market," not "in the market." on-time (adj.) op amp (n, singular), op amps (n, plural) Avoid. Spell out as operational amplifier or operational amplifiers. opcode (n) open-circuit (a) open core protocol (n) No hyphen because open in this context means openly licensed. An open core protocol. open drain (n), open-drain (adj.) open-end (adj.) open loop (n), open-loop (adj.) OptiFlash memory technology Write “OptiFlash” with a capital “O” and capital “F.” Do not put a space between “Opti” and “Flash.” Use the phrase “OptiFlash memory technology” on first reference; on subsequent references, “OptiFlash technology” is acceptable. The word “OptiFlash” is not trademarked. Do not include a ™ or ® symbol with this term. optimal Referring to a TI device as "optimal" for certain applications can be legally problematic because such statements can be viewed as creating implied warranties for the suitability of a device in an application, according to the TI Legal Department. TI specifically disclaims such implied warranties, and it's prudent to avoid statements that could expose TI to increased liability. It's ultimately customers' responsibility to determine whether a TI device is right for an application, and so you should avoid words such as "optimal" when describing TI products. Among the alternatives: 1. With their consent, you can quote TI customers who have indicated that TI parts are a good fit for specific applications. 2. If you can't provide a quote but could demonstrate that a statement is true if pressed to do so, you can say that TI customers have chosen these TI parts for similar applications and have reported positive results. (Of course you shouldn't cite customer names unless you have permission.) 3. You can cite figures concerning customers' use of certain TI devices for certain applications (or for applications involving similar conditions). Here are some other options to consider that state the concept in more objective terms about TI’s intent with the product, or that clearly state the customer as the decision-maker: Objective terms: is designed for is optimized for offers benefits for Benefits (as a verb) Customer decides: Many engineers choose Meets the xxx design challenge can enable can provide opto Avoid the abbreviation "opto" when referring to an optocoupler. optocoupler (n) optoelectronics (n) opto-emulator (n.) Use a hyphen in this device type for two reasons: 1. We already have precedent for a hyphen when what follows the opto- prefix begins with a vowel (opto-isolators). 2. The word “toe” kind of sticks out in “optoemulators” – like “op” “toe” rather than “opto.” Tech Docs also leans toward the hyphen. optomechanical (adj.) Ordering & quality Use Ordering & quality as the title for an OPN table on a TI.com product page. The previous name for this table was the "Order now" table. Order now Order now is the call to action when referring to purchasing, grouping purchasing links, or directing users to the ordering and quality component for devices or the ordering table for tools. organic LED (OLED) (n.) O-ring (n) OR (n, v, adj.), ORed (v), ORing (v, adj.) Example (adj.): OR gate oscillator (n) other companies' trademarks TI can normally use the trademarks of other companies to identify or indicate the source of their products with or without the ™ symbol. However, we do place a ™ or ® symbol after these external names on this list only, on first reference. DisplayPort™ Arm® Bluetooth® (italicize on first reference as well) Cortex® Linux® USB Type-C® USB-C® Wi-Fi® Zigbee® By "first reference," for example, you would say Bluetooth® on first reference but Bluetooth on subsequent references. You need not worry about a noun or noun phrase after the name. Never abbreviate another company's trademark or registered mark name. For example, never use BLE as an abbreviation for Bluetooth® Low Energy. Uppercase the words "low energy"; the Bluetooth SIG updated their guidelines in July 2018. Oxford comma See https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/comma-2 Package types and package dimensions Package types Spell out package type acronyms on first reference and use the acronym on subsequent references. TI has a packaging terminology website that has a pretty comprehensive list of package acronyms and what they stand for, along with other helpful definitions. One package type not on the TI website is WSON, which appears to stand for very very thin small outline no-lead. The "very very" becomes two Vs = a W. Never use the noun "package" after an acronym that itself includes the word package. For example, "WCSP package" is redundant because it is saying "wafer chip-scale package package." Package dimensions Use hyphens, including hyphens around the word "by," between the number and measurement for package dimensions when the dimensions are modifying a noun. Use the word "by" in regular text. Use the multiplication symbol (×) in a table or other space-constrained content. Examples: Available in a 2.4-mm-by-2.4-mm die-size ball-grid array (DSBGA) package or wafer chip-scale package (WCSP), and a 3-mm-by-3-mm quad flat no-lead (QFN)-16 package, these devices are up to 36% smaller than the competition. Use spaces, not hyphens, between the number and measurement for package dimensions when the dimensions stand alone: Ex.: The package is 3 mm by 3 mm. Pins refer to the number of pins that come with the package. A package's body size and the number of pins it has are typically expressed together because these two things are interdependent on one another. Example in regular text converting the number after the package name to the pin quantity: 16-pin DSBGA (2.4 mm by 2.4 mm) 16-pin WQFN (3 mm by 3 mm) 16-pin DSBGA (2.4 mm by 2.4 mm) 16-pin WQFN (3 mm by 3 mm) 16-pin WQFN (3 mm by 3 mm) 16-pin TSSOP (5 mm by 4.4 mm) 16-pin WQFN (3 mm by 3 mm) 16-pin TSSOP (5 mm by 4.4 mm) Example in a table or other areas that are space-constrained: DSBGA-16 (2.4 mm × 2.4 mm) WQFN-16 (3 mm × 3 mm) DSBGA-16 (2.4 mm × 2.4 mm) WQFN-16 (3 mm × 3 mm) WQFN-16 (3 mm × 3 mm) TSSOP-16 (5 mm × 4.4 mm) WQFN-16 (3 mm × 3 mm) TSSOP-16 (5 mm × 4.4 mm) packup (n, adj.), pack up (v) parameter A parameter is defined as an individual specification of a product or part. Examples of parameters include the operating temperature range, the input voltage and the output voltage. parameter symbols Parameter symbols are somewhat like acronyms, but with subscripts that denote units of measurements and other meanings for a parameter. For example, the parameter symbol for input voltage is V<sub>IN</sub>, with the "IN" in capital letters and subscripted. When possible, define parameter symbols on first reference just as you would an acronym, with the parameter symbol in parentheses. For example, R<sub>SP</sub> means specific (Sp) on-resistance (R), so you would say in content: "Reducing the specific on-state resistance (R<sub>SP</sub>) minimizes die size ..." Please apply the styles below (including the subscripted portions and capital letters) to these parameter symbols. For RDSon, note the correct form is R<sub>DS(on)</sub>. Make an exception to AP style and do not use brackets within parentheses when you're defining R<sub>DS(on)</sub>. For example: "The MOSFET is always on and its parasitic diodes do not turn on due to its low drain-to-source on-resistance (R<sub>DS(on)</sub>)." Here are some other symbols. For a more comprehensive list, see the JEDEC document, "Reference Guide to Letter Symbols for Semiconductor Devices." It requires registration to download, but it's free. R<sub>DS(on)</sub> = drain-to-source on-resistance V<sub>IN</sub> = input voltage V<sub>OUT</sub> = output voltage V<sub>REF</sub> = reference voltage V<sub>DO</sub> = dropout voltage F<sub>SW</sub> = switching frequency T<sub>J</sub> = junction temperature If it is not possible to subscript, place parameter symbols in all capital letters: VIN, not Vin or vin. parametrics Use this term when referencing all of the specifications of a product or part. For example, "You'll find the parametrics for the OPA333 at www.ti.com/product/opa333." parking assistance Not park assist. Avoid using verbs as nouns. part page A part page is a page on TI.com that provides information about TI orderable part numbers (OPNs). For example, here is the product page for the OPA333AID: https://www.ti.com/store/ti/en/p/product/?p=OPA333AID. Do not use the terms "part detail page" or "TI store page" in any external content, as we only use those terms internally. pass band (n), pass-band (adj.) passion statement/What We Do The passion statement is: Our passion is to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. Always use the full text of the passion statement; do not edit or trim this statement down in any way. Refer to the statement specifically as our “passion.” Similarly, per Nancy on 12-9-21, be extremely selective when using the phrase "Engineering Progress," and only in pre-approved uses. Do not use Engineering Progress in content except exactly how it is on the What We Do section of TI.com: "For decades, we have operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. We were pioneers in the transition of the world from vacuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits (ICs) – and we’ve been advancing IC technology and the ability to reliably produce ICs in high volumes for decades. Each generation of innovation builds upon the last to make technology smaller, more efficient, more reliable and more affordable – making it possible for semiconductors to go into electronics everywhere. We think of this as Engineering Progress. It’s what we do and have been doing for decades: • The object-detection capability used in a $20 million military radar system from the 1980s is now possible using a $20 radar chip in automobiles everywhere to increase vehicle safety and reduce collisions. • Home automation systems that cost tens of thousands of dollars 20 years ago are now only hundreds of dollars. Today, these systems are more accessible to homeowners and are making homes safer, more convenient and more energy efficient. • Technology that previously was only used in expensive factory robotic systems is affordable enough to be integrated into home appliances, making common household tasks, like vacuuming, easier and more convenient. Our passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors is alive today as we help our customers develop new applications, particularly in the industrial and automotive markets." pass-through (n, adj.) pathname (n) P-channel (n) peak load (n) peak-to-peak (adj.) pended (v) personification of inanimate objects Be careful in assigning what may seem to be human traits to inanimate objects. While there are a few that we can use (a sensor senses), avoid these words: • decide • determine (for example, The module determines ...) • expect or expects • feel • hear • know • like (when used to mean to enjoy or prefer, not in the context of comparing) • look • see • talk • think • touch • want or wants person-machine (n, adj.) person-year (n, adj.), person-month (n, adj.), person-hour (n, adj.) PFC (n) PFC stands for power factor correction. phase-in (n, adj.) phase-locked loop (n), phase-locked-loop (adj.) phase-shift (n, adj.) Revise sentences that use phase-shift as a verb. photocoupler (n) photocurrent (n) photodetection (n) photodetector (n) Not photo-detector. photodiode (n) Not photo-diode. photo-electron (n) photoetch (v), photoetching (n) photogenerated (adj.) photoinduced (adj.) photoluminescence (n) photoresist (v), photoresistance (n, adj.) photothyristor (n) phototransistor (n) picosecond (n) Abbreviate to ps when used with a number. piece part (n), piece-part (adj.) piezoelectric (adj.) pinout (n) pixel (n) The word pixel is short for picture element. Plug & Charge Capitalize and use the & symbol for this communications protocol. plug-in (n, adj.), plug in (v) Not plugin. PMOS PMOS is an acronym for P-channel metal-oxide semiconductor. PNP PNP is an acronym for P-channel N-channel P-channel. PNPN PNPN is an acronym for P-channel N-channel P-channel P-channel point of load (n), point-of-load (adj.) Hyphenate this term when used as an adjective modifying a noun. Example: point-of-load converter pop-up (n, adj.), pop up (v) positive-going (adj.) pound symbol (#) In formal communications, do not use # when referring to unit of weight or to stand for the word number. AP style is "No." (See the "No." entry.) The # symbol is appropriate on standardized purchasing or shipping forms. power architecture Use this term rather than "power tree." A power tree is a graphical representation of a system's power-management architecture. TI's FAEs use this simplified term when working with customers, who will draw a "tree" so that they can identify sockets. When referring to the arrangement of power-management circuits in a system, power architecture is a better term. Other possibilities are: · A power system implementation diagram. · A power-stage architecture. · A hierarchical design of power-management devices. A power topology refers to the type of converter/controller: buck, boost, flyback, and so on. power cycle (n, v) power down (n, v), power-down (adj.) power-driven (adj.) powered down (adj.) power-factor correction (n) See "PFC" entry. power good (n), power-good (adj.) power off (n, v), power-off (adj.) power on (n, v), power-on (adj.) Power over Ethernet (n) Capitalize the words "Power" and "Ethernet" but not "over." power path (n), power-path (adj.) Not PowerPath, Powerpath or powerpath. PowerPath is a Analog Devices product name. power-saving (adj.) power-supply design Always hyphenate "power supply" when it modifies the word "design." power tree A power tree is a graphical representation of a system's power-management architecture. TI's FAEs use this simplified term when working with customers, who will draw a "tree" so that they can identify sockets. But when referring to the arrangement of power-management circuits in a system, power architecture is a better term. Other possibilities are: · A power system implementation diagram. · A power-stage architecture. · A hierarchical design of power-management devices. A power topology refers to the type of converter/controller: buck, boost, flyback, and so on. power up (n, v), power-up (adj.), powered-up (adj.) preproduction Our preferred dictionary does not hyphenate preproduction. This term is used often in TI news releases to describe product availability. Price (and how to express currency types) Price is the table label used to display the unit price of a device available for purchase on TI.com. When listing currency type in a table column, use the three-digit currency codes established by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 4217 standard. You can find all of the currency codes here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217. Examples: Price (USD) Price (CNY) Qty | Price (USD) When listing currency type in any kind of marketing or technical content – within a regular sentence in a news release, for example – it is unlikely that you will be expressing a currency other than U.S. dollars. The correct format (which is also in a custom note to AP's currency conversions entry) is US$, not $US, U.S.$ or USD$. Do not put a space between the currency symbol and the amount. Examples: The 16-channel BQ79616-Q1 comes in a 10-mm-by-10-mm, 64-pin thermally enhanced thin quad flat package (HTQFP), priced at US$6.90 in 1,000-unit quantities. The SimpleLink 2.4GHz CC2662R-Q1 wireless MCU is priced at US$2.79 in 1,000-unit quantities. Here are the current currency types that you may find on TI.com and their associated symbols: China | CNY | ¥34.95 Japan | JPY | ¥34.95 Korea | KRW | ₩34.95 Taiwan | TWD | $34.95 Russia | RUB | ₽34.95 Euros | EUR | €34.95 Always use two decimal places when expressing a price. Examples: • In tables on TI.com: $15.00 • In written content: US$15.00 or ¥294.99" printed circuit board (n) printed-wiring board (n) printout (n), print out (v) processor (n) producible (adj.) product distribution center (PDC) The product distribution center is the location of the warehouse/storage from where TI ships items. product page A product page is a page on TI.com that provides information about TI generic part numbers (GPNs). For example, here is the product page for the OPA333: https://www.ti.com/product/OPA333. Do not use the term "product folder" in any external content. We only call them product folders internally. Profinet Profinet is an industrial Ethernet standard for factory automation. It is an abbreviation for process field network. PRU-ICSS PRU-ICSS is an acronym for programmable real-time unit-industrial communications subsystem. It is peripheral found in many TI Sitara™ processors. pseudocode (n) pseudo-differential (adj.) pseudonoise (n), pseudo-noise (adj.) pseudo-random (adj.) PSpice, PSpice® for TI Not PSPICE or Pspice. This is a brand name, and it's PSpice on their website, http://www.pspice.com/. The fact that this is a brand name takes precedence over the fact that it's an acronym, so you do not have to define PSpice on first reference (although it stands for personal computer simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis). When discussing the TI custom simulation tool, use the full name – Pspice® for TI – on first reference. PSpice is acceptable on subsequent references. publication names Capitalize the common words in a publication’s name only if it is part of its formal name. Check the publication’s masthead or website to determine its preferred usage. Do not use italics or put quotation marks around the name. Lowercase words such as “the” or “magazine” according to the publication’s convention: Example: The New York Times EDN magazine Time magazine SC Magazine DSP DesignLine newsletter pullback (n, adj.), pull back (v) pulldown (n, adj.), pull down (v) pull-push (adj.) pullup (n, adj.), pull up (v) In most cases, the word pullup is actually describing a pullup resistor or pullup resistance. pulse duration (n) pulse duration (n), pulse-width modulation (n), pulse-width-modulation (adj.) Do not use "pulse width" by itself as a noun. Years ago, the IEC, IEEE and JEDEC decided that "width" was a misnomer because width is measured in feet or inches, not in time. They decided to change "width" to "duration," which is measured in time. As a noun, say "pulse duration" rather than "pulse width." However, TI does not follow this rule for the very common term "pulse-width modulation." The word "width" is acceptable if the word "modulation" follows. See "PWM" entry. pulse-forming (adj.) pulse length (n) pulse modulation (n) pulser (n) pulse shape (n), pulse-shape (adj.) pulse-train (adj.) push-pull (adj.) push-push (adj.) PWM (n) PWM stands for pulse-width modulation. QML QML is an acronym for Qualified Manufacturers List. Note the capital letters. quantum (n, singular), quanta (n, plural) quasi- (adj.), quasi (n) Hyphenate the prefix quasi- if the word is an adjective. Two words and no hyphen if the word is a noun. quiescent current The parameter symbol for quiescent current is a capital I and a capital Q that is subscripted if possible, or a lowercase q if subscripting is not possible. Correct examples: I<sub>Q</sub>, Iq Incorrect examples: IQ, iq, iQ radiation-hardened (adj.) radiation hardness assured (n.), radiation-hardness-assured (adj.) This is the preferred term rather than radiation hardness assurance. Lowercase radiation hardness assured, even when choosing to cite the acronym RHA and using that acronym on subsequent references (see the "abbreviations and acronyms" entry for more information about lowercasing words that make up an acronym). Hyphenate radiation hardness assured when it modifies a noun. Example: The total ionizing dose quantifies the amount of accrued charged particle radiation over time during a mission and must be tested for every semiconductor wafer or wafer lot for radiation-hardness-assured products. radioactive (adj.) radio frequency (n), radio-frequency (adj.) rad (n) A unit of absorbed dose. ramp-down (n, adj.), ramp down (v) ramp-up (n, adj.), ramp up (v) random-access (adj.) ranges of time For a range of times, either “from” and “to” or a hyphen is acceptable, although “from” and “to” is more clear. Repeat the a.m. or p.m. for both numbers. Example: The session will run from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. range with negative numbers When expressing a range with negative numbers, do not use a hyphen to express the range. Use the word "to." Ex. -0.9-V to -5.5-V adjustable output voltage rank-ordering (n, v) rate-aiding (adj.) readback (n, adj.), read back (v) read-in (n, adj.), read in (v) read-only memory (n) read-only (n, adj.) readout (n, adj.), read out (v) read/write (n, adj.) real-case (adj.) real time (n), real-time (adj.) Example (n): I asked her how to find the information on the computer, and she came up with an answer in real time. Example (adj.): The TI-Navigator™ system provides real-time communication between students and teacher. recalibration (n) receiver (n) recidivous (adj.) reconfigure (v) reference design page A reference design page is a page on TI.com that provides information about TI reference designs. For example, here is the page for the -8-V Inverting Buck-Boost Reference Design: http://www.ti.com/tool/PMP30916. Do not use the term "reference design folder" in any external content. That is only a term used internally. Never refer to reference designs by their PMP, TIDM or TIDA numbers. Always use the official title of the reference design in any content. registration mark ® These TI trademarked products use use the ® (registered trademark) symbol, for reasons related to their intended market or because they are products gained through acquisitions: DLP® chip (there are several other approved nouns at the top of this page: http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/legal/trademark/tradeservice.htm) DLP Cinema® chip (there are several other approved nouns at the top of this page: http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/legal/trademark/tradeservice.htm) Jaguar® motor controller SIMPLE SWITCHER® power converter or SIMPLE SWITCHER® computer programs WEBENCH® circuit design and selection simulation services All other TI trademarks take a ™ symbol. regulator (n) rem (n) A unit of radiation dosage. It is derived from the phrase roentgen equivalent man. reparable (adj.) Not repairable. replacement product When a given GPN or OPN at TI is in a later life-cycle status (defined as not recommended for new designs [NRND], last time buy or obsolete), TI will recommend a replacement product, accompanied by a replacement code, to help distinguish whether the replacement product: • Is an exact equivalent and pin-to-pin compatible. • Has the same functionality and is pin-to-pin compatible but is not an exact equivalent. • Has the same functionality but is not pin-to-pin compatible. • Has similar functionality but is not pin-to-pin compatible. For examples of when it's OK to say replacement part instead of replacement product, see this custom AP Stylebook entry: https://www.apstylebook.com/custom_ap_entries/132692. reprioritization (n) Request sample Request sample is the call to action when a device has a sample available in sample purchase or request pages. This term is not applicable to tools on TI.com. rerun (v) Not re-run. resistor (n) resume (n), resume (v) You only need to apply the accent aigu (´) to the noun "resumé" if the verb "resume" is also in the sentence. retransmit (v), retransmission (n) reverse current (n), reverse-current (adj.) RFID RFID is an acronym for radio-frequency identification. RF-sampling transceiver Use a hyphen in the phrase "RF-sampling transceiver." The transceiver is sampling radio frequencies, so applying the hyphenated modifier rule is correct. right angle (n), right-angle (adj.) rise time (n), rise-time (adj.) RMS RMS stands for root mean square. robust The word “robust” is considered business jargon; in a meeting with representatives of the media who cover TI, they requested that we stop using the word because it’s been overused to the point that it has no meaning. Replace with “resilient,” "durable" or “reliable” if applicable in that context (and still technically accurate) or delete it entirely. roentgen (n, adj.) rolloff (n), roll off (v) rollover (n, adj), roll over (v) root mean square (n), root-mean-square (adj.) See "RMS" entry. row-multiplexed (adj.) rundown (n, adj.), run down (v) run-in (n, adj.) runoff (n), run off (v) run-on (n, adj.), run on (v) run time (n), runtime (adj.) Example (n): The Impedance Track™ gas gauge calculates the remaining run time at a given average load using both open-circuit voltage and impedance information. Example (adj.): The DSP/BIOS™ kernel provides runtime services that developers can use to build DSP applications and manage application resources. Safety Integrity Level (SIL), Automotive Integrity Safety Level (ASIL) Spell out SIL on first reference if you plan to use the acronym in subsequent references. Despite widespread usage, there is no hyphen between SIL and its 1, 2, 3 or 4 level. Correct: SIL 2 Incorrect: ASIL-2 The same rules apply to ASIL: Spell out ASIL on first reference if you plan to use the acronym in subsequent references. Despite widespread usage, there is no hyphen between ASIL and its A, B, C or D level. Correct: ASIL D Incorrect: ASIL-D said (in quote attributions) When attributing a quote, the order of the speaker's name and the verb said varies. If you will be including the speaker’s job title or adding details to provide context, place the verb first, then the name. Examples: “This acquisition is about strength and growth,” said Rich Templeton, president, chairman and CEO of Texas Instruments. “Cash flow from operations was $516 million,” said Senior Vice President and CFO Rafael Lizardi, speaking during an earnings call. For subsequent references after any initial introductions, place the speaker’s name first, then the verb: Examples: “There is great opportunity for share expansion,” Templeton said. “This was down $714 million from the last quarter,” Lizardi said. The Infolink news team prefers the attribution “said” in all instances rather than synonyms like “explained.” same as product A same as product at TI is a product that is exactly the same as another OPN but has a different part number. A same as product, formerly known as an alias or alternative part number, often appears in the Order Now table and the Product Detail section on a product page on TI.com. The standard hover text explaining a same as product is: This part number is identical to the part number listed above. You can only order quantities of the part number listed above. savings (n) The words savings takes a plural verb. scan line (n), scan-line (adj.) scannable (adj.) scheduler (n) Schmitt trigger (n) Schottky (n, adj.) Not Schottkey or schottky. screenshot (n) sea of gates (n), sea-of-gates (adj.) second-source (adj.) semiconductor (n) sensorless (adj.) sensor (n) SEPIC SEPIC is an acronym for a single-ended primary-inductor converter. SerDes SerDes is an abbreviation for serializer deserializer. Do not use SERDES. servoaccelerometer (n) servoamplidyne (n) servoamplifier (n) servoassembly (n) servobrake (n) servocarrier (n) servocontroller (n) servodrive (n) servoerror (n) servofeed (n) servolink (n) servoloop (n, adj.) servomechanism (n) servomotor (n) servomultiplier (n) servo (n) servonetwork (n) servooutput (n) servosignal (n) servosystem (n) setback (n, adj.), set back (v) setpoint (n, related to control systems), set point (n, a medical and sports term) set-top box (n) set up (v), setup (n, adj) shared-aperture (adj.) shoot-through (n, adj.), shoot through (v) short circuit (n), short-circuit (v, adj.) short-term (adj.) shortwave (n, adj.) SiC SiC stands for silicon carbide. Define on first reference. Note the lowercase "i." SiC is pronounced like the word "sick," so the appropriate article is "a" SiC, not "an" SiC. sidelobe (n, adj.) side-looking (adj.) siemens (n) A unit of measure. See "mho" entry. signaling (n, v, adj.) signal-to-noise ratio signoff (n, adj.), sign off (v) silicone (n, an organic compound) silicon (n, an element) silkscreen (n, adj.), silk screen (v) similar product A similar product is a product that TI considers similar to a given GPN but is not a required replacement. A similar product, formerly known as a recommended alternative product," is presented for only customer consideration. sin/cos Please spell out sin/cos to sine/cosine. While we discourage the slash in many other instances, it is acceptable here. sine function (n) sine wave (n), sine-wave (adj.) single-access RAM (n) You do not have to spell out RAM on first reference. See "RAM" entry. single-phrase (adj.) single-pole single-throw (adj.) slip-on (n, adj.), slip on (v) slitted (adj.) small-scale (adj.) smart-idle mode (n) SoC You may see this abbreviation spelled out as both "system-on-chip" and "system-on-a-chip." System-on-chip is a bit of a Frankenstein-like shortening of system-on-a-chip. Also, system-on-a-chip makes it slightly more obvious that the word "system" is, inherently, a plural concept. Correct: system-on-a-chip (SoC) Now having said that, for the plural – SoCs – when defining on first reference, say systems-on-a-chip (SoCs). Note the lowercase "o" in SoC. soft copy (n) soft start (n), soft-start (adj.) software page A software page is a page on TI.com that provides information about TI software. For example, here is the software page for Code Composer Studio™ software: https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO. Do not use the term "software folder" in any external content. That is only a term used internally. solid-state (adj.) solid-state relay (n.) Hyphenate solid-state relay. solution In general, we do not refer to TI products or designs as a “solution.” Customers use our products, reference designs and other resources to develop their own solutions. This is especially important to remember when talking about medical equipment. spatial (adj.) Not spacial. speakerphone (n) special-purpose (adj.) spectrum (n, singular), spectra or spectrums (n, plural) spin-down (n, adj.), spin down (v) spinlock (n) spin-off (n, adj.), spin off (v) TI takes exception to the AP Stylebook decision; do not make spinoff one word as a noun or adjective. spin-up (n, adj.), spin up (v) spokespeople or spokespersons TI prefers spokespeople as the plural of spokesperson. spot-check (v, adj.), spot check (n) spread-spectrum (adj.) square wave (n), square-wave (adj.) stackup (n), stack up (v) standards, interfaces and protocols As an exception to some AP guidance in its Ask the Editor questions (specific to Internet Protocol, for example, which they no longer lowercase), at TI, we capitalize the names of all standards, interfaces and protocols. Here are some examples: Voice over Internet Protocol Profinet (not PROFINET, because AP doesn't all-cap abbreviations that are pronounceable) EtherCAT Ethernet/Internet Protocol Controller Area Network Local Interconnect Network Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol Here's a Wikipedia entry that will take you to various lists of network protocols: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_network_protocols Even though we're making an exception to AP, there are a few that we do lowercase because they are so ubiquitous. They are: application programming interface (API is now acceptable on first reference as the acronym) graphical user interface standby (n, adj.), stand by (v) standing-wave ratio (n) standoff (n, adj.), stand off (v) standstill (n), stand still (v) start bit (n), start-bit (adj.) start of conversion (n), start-of-conversion (adj.) Do not make this term an acronym. SOC/SoC has too much recognition at TI as system on chip. stateful (adj.) state machine (n), state-machine (adj.) state of charge (n), state-of-charge (adj.) state of charge (n), state-of-charge (adj.), state of health (n), state-of-health (adj.) Do not make this term an acronym. SOC/SoC has too much recognition at TI as system on a chip. Because state of charge and state of health are often used together, for consistency reasons, do not make the term state of health into the acronym SOH. state of the art (n), state-of-the-art (adj.) step-down (n, adj.), step down (v) step-up (n, adj.), step up (v) stop band (n), stop-band (adj.) stop bit (n), stop-bit (adj.) StrataFlash (n) streamline (v), streamlined (adj.) Sub-1GHz Capitalize the word "sub" in all instances. Do not put a hyphen between 1 and GHz . subheadings/subtitles For consistency, apply the same treatment you used in the title, whether it's upstyle or downstyle (see those entries in TI's Custom Stylebook). For example, a subheading in a news release should be downstyle. A subheading in a solution guide should be upstyle. subsystem End equipment comprises subsystems, which are defined as a specific functional area involving one or more functional circuits. An example subsystem is an input user interface for a washing machine. superior, incredible, unprecedented, ultimate, state-of-the-art Avoid these words because they come across as exaggerations. Instead, use fact-based descriptions and helpful, useful information. superset (n) supply chain (n); supply-chain (adj.) This is an exception to answers in AP's Ask the Editor. surface-acoustic-wave (adj.) surface-mount (adj.) sustainability TI defines sustainability as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, integrating long-term economic, environmental and social dimensions into the way we operate our business." Sustainability is preferable to the more colloquial "green," although green may be more appropriate in a given situation. Note that AP does not put the word green in quotation marks, not even on first reference. switched mode, switch node Note the "ed" for mode but not node. switchover (n, adj.) sync-frame pulse (n) sync-frame signal (n) synchro (n) synchronism (n) synchronization (n) synchronize (v) synchronous (adj.) synthesizer (n) Not synth. system-level (adj.) system on module (SoM) The phrase system on module is not hyphenated when it stands alone. You would hyphenate it if the phrase were modifying a noun: system-on-module development. For consistency with SoC, the acronym for system on module is SoM with the lowercase "o." The plural would be SoMs. tail light (n) An exception to AP's bizarre "taillight." takeaway (n) takedown (n, adj.), take down (v) takeoff (n, adj.), take off (v) take-up (n), take up (v) Technical content Technical content refers to TI's collection of technical information that existing and potential customers use when designing or developing with TI products. Design resources on TI.com will eventually organize and display all relevant technical content, regardless of its format or TI's back-end system. Technical content Technical content is a submenu under the Design Resources header on TI.com. The intention is that that Design Resources roadmap will organize and display all relevant technical content, regardless of its format or TI back-end system. Use the term technical content when referring to TI's larger universe of technical information that is relevant to customers when they design or develop with TI parts. technical documentation/Technical Documentation The term technical documentation at TI refers to any and all documentation describing products, devices, software and TI assets. Do not use the now-retired term "technical documents." Technical Documentation is the business group at TI that produces the company's data sheets and other, well, technical documentation. "technology" as a noun after a TI trademark If you have checked the TI trademark list (http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/legal/trademark/tradeservice.htm) for what nouns are approved for use after a TI trademark and they do not seem suitable for the context, it's acceptable to use the word “technology.” Tech Notes From Randi Williams via email on May 3, 2018: As you know, Tech Notes were created last year and have become part of many product line’s content strategies. These “short application notes” have proven useful, especially to support building block products. As more and more ASC teams adopt them, we’ve started to discuss potential confusion with how they are classified on TI.com. Since they are technically short Application Notes, they are classified as Application Notes on TI.com. Outside the Tech Note icon and the Tech Note name in the heading, we don’t proactively brand them as a different content type. To avoid confusion by calling it a Tech Note but classifying it as an Application Note, we’ve decided we will no longer use the icon and will not push the “Tech Note” name externally. We will focus our energy on promoting the actual content - the volume and consistency of Tech Notes is what will be powerful, not branding them or creating a new content type. What’s changing: We will remove the icon on TI.com (it’s only in one place) We will stop putting the icon on the top corner of Tech Notes We will remove the Tech Note heading where it is on TI.com What’s not changing: The objective of Tech Notes and the format remain unchanged You can still refer to them as Tech Notes internally so the teams remain aligned and consistent All existing Tech Notes remain unchanged temperatures and temperature ranges An orderable part number (OPN) will sometimes include an operating temperature range. Always include the Celsius symbol (°) and the capital letter C when expressing temperature. For example: 210°C. There are no spaces between the number, the symbol or the C. When expressing a temperature range, use the word "to" instead of a hyphen: 0°C to 125°C –40°C to 125°C When expressing a negative temperature, use the en-dash, not a hyphen. This is what Technical Documentation prefers. tesla (a unit of measurement) An tesla is a unit of magnetic flux density. It is named after Nikola Tesla. As with every International System of Unit (SI) unit named for a person, its symbol starts with an upper case letter (T), but when written in full it follows the rules for capitalization of a common noun. Thus, capitalize "tesla" at the beginning of a sentence and in upstyle titles, but lowercase in downstyle titles and in a regular sentence. test bench (n), test-bench (adj.) test point (n), test-point (adj.) Texas Instruments (how to write the company name) The official, formal name of the company is Texas Instruments Incorporated (there is no comma between “Instruments” and “Incorporated”). Only include "Incorporated" in the most formal contexts, like the annual report or boilerplate. Do not abbreviate “Incorporated” to “Inc." (this is an exception to AP style). Abbreviating You can abbreviate Texas Instruments to TI if you cite the TI acronym properly on first reference in contributed articles or white papers, like this: Reduce board space with motor drivers from Texas Instruments (TI). The TI brushed DC motor driver portfolio has flexible control interface options. Because our data sheets have the logo and Texas Instruments spelled out on every page, it is not necessary to spell out Texas Instruments first; the first reference to the company in a data sheet can be TI. Possessive use You can make Texas Instruments possessive by adding an apostrophe, but it’s almost always clearer and more natural to abbreviate to TI’s, use Texas Instruments as a modifier, or simply recast the sentence. FLAT-OUT WRONG Texas Instrument’s new fab is now up and running. ACCEPTABLE Texas Instruments’ new fab is now up and running. BETTER The newest Texas Instruments fab is now up and running. BEST TI’s new fab is now up and running. Texas Instruments recently opened its newest fab. Note the use of the personal pronoun "its" in the "best" example above. See the "grammatical person" custom AP entry for examples of consistency between the third and second person within a sentence that talks about TI. thermoanalysis (n) thermoelectric (adj.) thick-film (adj.) thin-film (adj.) third-overtone crystal (n) Third-Party Network The official name of the program is the Third-Party Network. Use a hyphen between "Third" and "Party." It's not the third (as in after the second and the first) party network, it's the third-party network: a network of third parties. Correct examples: Third-party modules Third-party tool folder Buy from a third party Go to a third party Third-party products disclaimer Incorrect examples: Third party modules Third party tool folder Buy from a third-party Go to third-party Third party products disclaimer Do not refer to third parties as “partners,” as this could imply an official relationship with TI. Instead, refer to them as third-party "contributors," "software providers" or "service providers," or be specific about what they do: for example, a third-party "optical module manufacturer." this, that, these, those and it Watch for the overuse of demonstrative pronouns (this, that, these, those) and the pronoun “it.” A demonstrative pronoun makes it difficult for readers to remain engaged because they may become confused or frustrated. Bad examples: One approach to implement this is by using a current-fed converter. This information is then used to accurately determine the flow rate. This will support a 90%/10% duty cycle of a 40KHz PWM signal. The solution is to turn a demonstrative pronoun into a demonstrative adjective: this reference design, that method, these devices, those specifications. Search for at least “this” and “it” while reviewing your writing to eliminate vague references. When to use this or that, these or those "This" indicates something close to the speaker. "That" indicates something away from the speaker. "These" indicates some things close to the speaker. "Those" indicates some things away from the speaker. Be sure to use this/that with singular and non-count nouns and these/those with plural nouns. Examples: This article highlights several suggestions from home entertainment to on-the-move GPS devices to oral health care. That LEED certification sets the company apart. "It's through these relationships that we can enhance our competitive position, as well as those of our customers." through-hole (adj.) throughput (n, adj.) throw-off (n), throw off (v) TI.com Capitalize "TI" when using the name of our website. It's TI.com, whether or not you embed a hyperlink to the site. Correct: TI.com, www.ti.com Incorrect: ti.com, www.TI.com Lowercase "ti" when ti.com is part of a URL or alias, even for longer URLs: Correct: www.ti.com, ti.com/embeddedworld, https://www.ti.com/reference-designs/index.htm, https://www.ti.com/product/INA138 Incorrect: TI.com/embeddedworld TI.com inventory TI.com inventory is a label denoting the amount of inventory or stock for a device available for purchase from TI. Only use this term when referring to OPNs, not GPNs. The previous name for this label was "Availability." Always use a comma between every three digits in inventory quantities: Examples: 8,431 or 133,527 TI E2E™ trademark TI E2E™ is the correct trademark term (not E2E alone). TIer (n, singular), TIers (n, plural) A TI employee. Not Tier (watch for automatic lowercasing of the "i" in Microsoft Word) or TI'er. TI Functional Safety-Capable, TI Functional Safety Quality-Managed, TI Functional Safety-Compliant When these terms are acting as TI's categories of functional safety documentation, you may capitalize them but must add "TI" beforehand, in keeping with "TI BAW," "TI mmWave" and "TI E2E." Note that these are categories. You cannot describe a device as functionally safe or functionally managed or functionally compliant. We enable the customer's system to be these things. time base (n), time-base (adj.) time-code (adj.) time constant (n), time-constant (adj.) time frame (n), time-frame (adj.) time lapse (n), time-lapse (adj.) Time limit on using the word "new" From the Federal Trade Commission's Advertising FAQs: "New" Claims When can a company advertise a product as "new"? The answer depends on how the ad uses the word "new." For example, under the rules governing the identification of textiles, fabric cannot be advertised as "new" if it has been reclaimed or respun. The rules governing advertising claims for tires prohibit the use of the word "new" to describe retreads. However, when no specific regulation applies, each case must be considered within the context of the ad. At least one FTC advisory opinion has suggested a six-month limit on the use of the word when advertising the introduction of a "new" product not previously on the market. time-multiplexing (adj.) time of flight (n), time-of-flight (adj) The acronym for time of flight is ToF. timesaving (adj.) time-sharing (n, v) time slot (n) time span (n), time-span (adj.) timestamp (n, v) time-tested (adj.) time to market (n), time-to-market (adj.) Example (n): JPEG algorithms reduce time to market. Example (adj.): OEMs and ODMs reap a big time-to-market advantage with this TI WLAN chipset. TI site names Avoid abbreviations, acronyms and nicknames when referring to TI sites and worldwide locations: Examples: Kilby West, not KFAB South Campus, not Forest Lane Dallas Bump Wafer Fab, not DBump Do not insert a hyphen between TI and the name of the country or city: Example: TI Malaysia, not TI-Malaysia Do not use TI China. The word “China” is generally only allowed in a People's Republic of China company name if the entity is a holding company or investment company established in China. The company’s name in China is TI Semiconductor Technologies (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. TI solves problems The TI Law department believes that this is risky language. Always include the word "help": TI helps solve problems. TI store and buy on TI.com Do not use the phrase "TI store" except in select instances such as the API development process on TI.com. Do not use in copy or promotions; say "buy on TI.com" instead. For specific instances, you can seek approval from Nancy Kelly or Keith Hui. TI Technical Ladder Capitalize the titles on the TI Technical Ladder (Tech Ladder is also acceptable). TIers elected to the TI Technical Ladder can include their specific designation either as their sole job title or after their current job title. The steps on the TI Technical Ladder are (listed here in hierarchical order from low to high): Member Group Technical Staff Senior Member Technical Staff Distinguished Member Technical Staff TI Fellow TI Senior Fellow TI Principal Fellow Although TI Technical Ladder titles are commonly abbreviated (MGTS, SMTS, DMTS, Sr. Fellow), they should be spelled out, as many readers may not know the abbreviations. title The title at TI specifically refers to a documentation file or a link. It could be the HTML version of a page on TI.com or a PDF. titled Use "titled" when referring to the name of a document, like a book or application note. Entitled means a right to do or have something. It is not interchangeable with "titled." ToF ToF stands for time of flight. toolchain (n) toolkit (n) top-level (adj.) transceiver (n) transconductance (n) transistor (n) transmitter (n) traveling-wave tube (n) trifecta Do not capitalize or place the word trifecta in quotes. At TI, trifecta is an early indicator of a product's year-one success. To hit trifecta, a product must meet three goals within 12 months of its release to market: • More than 10 $1,000 customers. • More than 60% cost of billings margin (COBM). • More than $60,000 in revenue. Example: ASC had 51 parts that met trifecta in October 2018. tri-state This term is preferable to "3-state." While historically, TI avoided tri-state when used as a noun or a verb because the term had been trademarked, the company that had trademarked it was National Semiconductor. Given our acquisition of National in 2011, it should now be fine for us to use "tri-state" in any part of speech. tunable (adj.) tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) Make magnetoresistance all one word. turnaround (n), turn around (v) turnkey (n, adj.) turnoff (n, adj.), turn off (v) turnon (n, adj.), turn on (v) TÜV SÜD TÜV stands for Technischer Überwachungsverein. SÜD is a German word meaning south. Note that the correct name is TÜV SÜD, with the German umlauts (the two dots). If your content will not allow the umlauts, the correct term is then TUEV SUED. In English, TÜV SÜD would be South Technical Inspection Association. twisted pair (n), twisted-pair (adj.) two-dimensional (adj.) two's complement (n), 2's complement (n), two's-complement (adj.), 2's-complement (adj.) TX/RX TX stands for "transmit" or "transmitter" and RX stands for "receive" or "receiver." Uppercase the Xs in TX and RX. type At TI, "type" is a category used to group documentation that is similar, which enables filtering. Always use the word type as a column table when listing document types in a table. U-boot (n, adj.) undesirable Consider avoiding forms of the noun "desire" in high-tech content. Replace undesirable with unintended, unwanted or detrimental. un-ionized (adj.) units of measure Do not place a space or a hyphen between a number and an abbreviated unit of measure. Examples: Up to 400Mbps speeds As high as 1GHz A 720MHz DSP The 1GHz product A 65nm process node One 12V option –48V supplies 300mm wafers A <1mA radio 42fs jitter performance Partial timing support ±1µs 45nm to 130nm process technology A 50A wire harness has 2mΩ-per-meter and 1.5µH-per-meter characteristics This rule, applicable as of Jan. 1, 2024, disregards whether or not a number and abbreviated unit of measurement modify a noun (as in the phrase “77GHz band”) or not (“a bandwidth of 77GHz”). It is our standard guidance to abbreviate all units of measure when they appear with a number. Incorrect example: The simulation was over in 10milliseconds. Memory sizes When the unit denotes memory size, you should also not use a space. Wikipedia has a long history about the confusion that resulted when “early computer scientists used k to mean 1,000” when talking about computer memory. They really meant 2 to the power of 10, which is 1,024. Therefore, use industry-standard style for abbreviations of memory units, as shown in the examples here. Examples: kilobits | 128K bits | 128Kb kilobytes | 128K bytes | 128KB kiloword | 6K word | 6KW megabits | 32M bits | 32Mb megabytes | 32M bytes | 32MB gigabit | 1G bit, 2G bits | 1Gb, 2Gb gigabyte | 1G byte, 2G bytes | 1GB, 2GB upconversion (n, adj.), upconvert (v), upconverter (n, adj.) upstyle Upstyle, also known as title case, means to capitalize "principal" words, including the first word, proper nouns, prepositions and conjunctions of four or more letters. Apply upstyle only to the main title (capitalizing all principal words) in these content types, which are usually in PDF format. All subheadings in these content types should be downstyle. • Books • E-books (if compiling a group of content types with varied capitalization standards; exceptions are possible for the subheadings and graphics) • Paid search ads • Reference design user guides (PDFs) • Selection guides • White papers (both technical white papers and marketing white papers) Apply upstyle to the main titles and all subheadings (capitalizing all principal words) in all traditional technical documentation, such as the examples listed below. Figure and table labels are also upstyle, consistent with TI technical documentation standards. • Application notes • Data sheets • Radiation and reliability reports • User guides Downstyle takes precedence for content types not listed. The main title of all .pdf documents at TI should be upstyle. Examples: How to Drive Resistive, Inductive, Capacitive and Lighting Loads Interface TSC Through McBSP A product type descriptor on a chip photo is upstyle: Example: Data Converter A business entity name unique to TI is upstyle: Examples: Embedded Processing, Linear Power Branded product names are upstyle. Always follow a ® or ™ name with an approved – lowercased – noun: Examples: SimpleLink™ wireless MCU, DLP® Pico products Video thumbnails only: all capital letters, for readability in small format. If the content type is not listed above, contact charmaine@ti.com to add it to this list. uptime (n) up-to-date (adj.) usable (adj.) USB Power Delivery USB is always in capital letters and Power Delivery always uses initial caps. This term does not have a trademark or registration mark after it. You can make Power Delivery an acronym for subsequent references by inserting “(PD)” after the first reference, so that going forward it's "USB PD." If a USB Type-C® product also supports USB Power Delivery, USB-IF recommends the following language for all marketing materials: • (PRODUCT) supports USB Power Delivery It is OK to mention Power Delivery independently of USB Type-C®. The USB Implementers Forum took down a document that stated this (https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/usb_type-c_language_product_and_packaging_guidelines_20230320.pdf) and you also can find an explanation of how they differ here (https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/industry-articles/usb-pd-vs-usb-c-differences-benefits-and-adapters/). And here's an article explaining whether the standard can transfer video (https://www.anker.com/blogs/hubs-and-docks/do-all-usb-c-cables-support-video). • USB Type-C is not USB Power Delivery. USB Power Delivery is a protocol/hardware solution that increases USB power capabilities up to 100W. These terms are not interchangeable. • If a product features USB Type-C, it does not necessarily support USB Power Delivery or USB 3.2. Device manufacturers can choose to support USB Power Delivery or USB 3.2 performance, but it is not required for USB Type-C products. USB Type-C®, USB-C® and Extended Power Range (Updated Aug. 3, 2020 and Jan. 5, 2024) Use the ® symbol on first mention only. USB is always in capital letters and Type-C always uses initial caps. Always place a hyphen between “Type” and “C.” USB Type-C® and USB-C® are registered trademarks of the USB Implementers Forum (IF), which recommends the full term when specifically referencing the specification or in these types of content: • Press releases. • Technology bulletins. • Product announcements. • Product spec sheets. • Product manuals. • Product websites. The USB-IF is also OK with USB-C if there are space constraints in the content or "for other marketing purposes." Examples of these content types are: • Spokesperson quotes. • Marketing videos or advertisements. • Collateral, including brochures and handouts. • Event signage. • Retail displays. • Social media promotions. • Presentations, speeches, podcasts or webinars. • Marketing emails. Capitalize Extended Power Range per the USB Implementers Forum. It is OK to make this term into the acronym EPR if it will appear again in the content. For more specific information about what verbs to use when describing USB Type-C and USB Power Delivery, see https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/usb_type-c_language_product_and_packaging_guidelines_20230320.pdf. use case (n), use-case (adj.) TI communicators are increasingly using "use case" interchangeably with "application." But there are differences. A use case is the set of requirements that may be common across several different applications or end equipment. An application is a use of electronics to meet specific requirements. user interface (n) using font styles for emphasis Readability studies have found that bold provides the most emphasis. Do not use italics, underlines or all capital letters for emphasis. Italics do appear in AP Stylebook entries, but only to highlight examples of correct and incorrect usage. The Associated Press has never recommended italics because they didn't transmit through news wires. Using the letter X in place of device numbers In marketing content, it's best to avoid using upper or lowercase Xs in device numbers. On first reference, use the specific device number. On subsequent references, refer to the family name or call it "the device." If the content is about a family of devices, refer to the primary device, also known at TI as the hero device, as a representative device for the family. In technical content such as data sheets or any content that goes through Technical Documentation, a lowercase x is acceptable as a replacement for one or more of the numbers in a TI device name to refer to the family of devices. This rule exists because a data sheet might represent 20 different GPNs, which would look terrible in a title (or every time you needed to mention it). Technical Documentation tested organic search that showed that using either the specific device number or the family device number as terms does send users to a TI data sheet as one of the first three items. If a customer performs a search within TI.com (not a search engine) for a part number (not with the X), they will find the data sheet. For example, a search for both LMG3411R150 and LMG3410R150 offered up the data sheet in the top three results. (The first result was the EVM and the second result was the product folder.) If a customer searches for a part number within TI.com (not a search engine) that includes an X, they will also find the data sheet. For example, a search for the LMG3411R150 resulted in the data sheet twice – once for each GPN with which it was associated. Do not use slashes instead of Xs. That's an old practice. Using the letter X to indicate an amount Do not use the letter X (uppercase or lowercase) to indicate the number of components in a design or bill of materials. Using the letter X when the intent is only to provide an amount of anything is confusing because readers may misinterpret the X to mean a times increase or decrease, or that you are multiplying. Incorrect: This solution would require 4x LDOs. Incorrect: Figure 1 depicts a 3x3 MIMO system with multiple transmit and receive antennas. Incorrect: Such immense bandwidth would be typical of a 16-lane (x16) link between two PCIe nodes, each lane operating at 32 Gbps. Using the letter X to mean times: "X times" to express an increase or decrease Do not use the letter X (uppercase or lowercase) to indicate an increase or decrease, especially a decrease. Because the word "times" traditionally implies multiplication in the English language, it is not possible to multiply and obtain a smaller product. It is common at TI to compare or contrast current or voltage measurements, number of components, or sizes such as packages using "times." But it can be confusing to express such comparisons this way in English. In this incorrect example, it is unclear whether 2x less means the same as half the power of competing solutions or 50 percent less than competing solutions. Incorrect: A new automotive Ethernet physical layer (PHY) chip requires half the external component count and board space and as little as 2x less the power compared to competing solutions. Instead of X or times, express increases or decreases with: • A fraction, keeping in mind that fractions are spelled out according to Associated Press style (one-tenth, not 1/10th). Incorrect: A three-phase BLDC motor system is 5x smaller in size than a single-phase AC induction motor system. Correct: A three-phase BLDC motor system is one-fifth the size of a single-phase AC induction motor system. • A percentage. Use the calculator at https://www.blitzresults.com/en/percentage-calculator/ to help express percentages accurately. See in particular the "Percentage increase or decrease of a value" heading. Incorrect: Many cells are approaching 800 Wh/L, which is more than a 2x increase in the last 10 years. Correct: Many cells are approaching 800 Wh/L, which is more than a 100% increase in the last 10 years. • If applicable, the word "half" or the word "double." Incorrect: But for the lower-voltage 1.8-V case, there is nearly a 2x reduction in battery current drawn between the DC/DC and the LDO. Correct: But for the lower-voltage 1.8-V case, the reduction in battery current drawn between the DC/DC and the LDO is nearly half. utilize Avoid. Replace with "use." valence electron (v) variable-frequency oscillator (n) var (n) var stands for volt-ampere reactive. VDE VDE stands for Verband der Elektrotechnik. very-high-frequency (adj.) very-high-speed (adj.) very-large-scale (adj.) very-low-frequency (adj.) vestigial sideband (n) via Do not use via as a synonym for the word "through," because "via" has a semiconductor-industry-specific definition as a noun. Use through in such instances. A via (Latin for path or way, also known as vertical interconnect access) is an electrical connection between layers in a physical electronic circuit that goes through the plane of one or more adjacent layers. It is a plated-through hole used only for a signal trace, not a component lead. Examples: Connecting these pads with vias provides the best possible path for conduction between the die and the skin. The imager in Figure 2 uses a Mobile Industry Processor Interface (MIPI) Camera Serial Interface (CSI), and you can see the vias that connect the controlled impedance traces from the FPD-link device to the imager. video band (n) videocassette (n) v, n, adj., adv., abbr. Abbreviations for parts of speech in Custom AP Stylebook entries. v = verb n = noun adj. = adjective adv. = adverb voltage drop, voltage droop, voltage decrease These terms have distinct meanings. Do not use "drop," "droop" or "decrease" interchangeably. • A voltage drop means that voltage values have or will decrease. However, you cannot replace "voltage drop" with “voltage decrease” because a voltage drop occurs across a component, typically a resistor. In addition, engineers typically know exactly what this drop is, so it does feel right in this context. Think of a situation when there is a flat road and you have a drop; voltage will behave the same way when it goes through some components in an electrical circuit. Most of the time it is an expected decrease versus an unexpected decrease. • A voltage droop, also known as “voltage sag,” is used typically for AC voltages, where the voltage will suddenly droop due to overloading or some other electrical anomalies. It is not the same as a voltage drop, since it is not across a particular component and usually happens unexpectedly. Think of a sinusoid drooping due to a fault in a circuit. Voltage decrease is also not applicable here, since a droop or a sag are industry terms and specifically used to characterize an unexpected change. • If a circuit only has DC voltages, it is OK to say "voltage decrease” for conditions where there is an expected or unexpected drop in voltage at the output or input of a pin. If an AC/DC or DC/DC power supply is overloaded, you can say that the output is expected to decrease, or that the output voltage decreases when the load current is higher than 500 mA. voltage slew rate (dv/dt) Measured in V/µs. Define dv/dt as voltage slew rate on first reference. volt-ampere (n) voltmeter (n) wafer fabrication (fab) From TI's manufacturing terminology webpage: The semiconductor chip manufacturing process starts with wafer fabrication (fab). Fab locations transform a circular piece of ultra-pure silicon, called silicon wafers, into individual chips through thousands of process machines, lasers, ultra-precision optics and advanced robotics. wait pin (n) wait state (n), wait-state (adj.) wakeup (n), wake-up (adj.), wake up (v) walk-through (n) wall box (n); wall-box (adj) Not Wallbox or wallbox. Wallbox (one word) is the name of an EV charging company, so to avoid any confusion, we need to avoid it and either say wall-box chargers or wall boxes. washout (n, adj.), wash out (v) watchdog (n, adj.) watchpoint (n) waveform (n, adj.) waveguide (n, adj.) wavelength (n, adj.) wave train (n) wave trap (n) wear-out (adj.), wear out (v) weber (n) A unit of measure. well-adjusted (adj.) well-known (adj.) well-organized (adj.) well-regulated (adj.) well-suited Referring to a TI device as "well-suited" for certain applications can be legally problematic because such statements can be viewed as creating implied warranties for the suitability of a device in an application, according to the TI Legal Department. TI specifically disclaims such implied warranties, and it's prudent to avoid statements that could expose TI to increased liability. It's ultimately customers' responsibility to determine whether a TI device is right for an application, and so you should avoid words such as "well-suited" when describing TI products. Among the alternatives: 1. With their consent, you can quote TI customers who have indicated that TI parts are a good fit for specific applications. 2. If you can't provide a quote but could demonstrate that a statement is true if pressed to do so, you can say that TI customers have chosen these TI parts for similar applications and have reported positive results. (Of course you shouldn't cite customer names unless you have permission.) 3. You can cite figures concerning customers' use of certain TI devices for certain applications (or for applications involving similar conditions). Here are some other options to consider that state the concept in more objective terms about TI’s intent with the product, or that clearly state the customer as the decision-maker: Objective terms: is designed for is optimized for offers benefits for Benefits (as a verb) Customer decides: Many engineers choose Meets the xxx design challenge can enable can provide while, although Although many editors replace instances of “while” with “although” when the context does not mean “at the same time,” AP makes no such distinction and allows the word “while” to be used interchangeably with “although.” When using the word “while,” make sure that no confusion would arise where readers might not understand if the two phrases occurred simultaneously or if the second half of the sentence was a converse thought to the first. The meaning should be clear. whiteout One word per Webster's New World College Dictionary. white paper A white paper is a report or guide that describes a complex issue or application space concisely and may presents TI philosophy. White paper is always two words; never whitepaper. white paper Two words. who, that Use who for references to human beings. Use that for organizations, teams and companies. Examples: The leadership team: that. "We have a leadership team that provides ..." The team members on that leadership team: who. "We have leadership team members who provide ..." wideband (adj.) wide band gap (n) wide band-gap (adj.) The rule for band gap applies when the qualifier "wide" appears in front of the phrase. wildcard This is an exception to AP style, which treats the term as two words, because AP is referring to the playing card and not to its definition in the computer industry. In computing, a wildcard refers to a character that can be substituted for zero or more characters in a string. Wildcards are commonly used in computer programming, database SQL search queries, and when navigating through DOS or Unix directories via the command prompt. wire-band (adj.) wire-bond (adj., v) word step (n) workaround (n) workflow (n) work function (n) work group A group of people who are collectively working on a project. Two words, lowercase. work-hour (n) work-life (adj.) Two words and hyphenated (rather than a slash). In this case, "work" does not modify "life", but they do each modify or further describe "balance." By placing a hyphen between the two, they become equal or compound modifiers of "balance." worst case (n), worst-case (adj.) wraparound (n, adj.), wrap around (v) writeback (n), write back (v) write-only (n, adj.) write-up (n, adj.) x-axis (n, adj.) x-band (n, adj.) X-capacitor, Y-capacitor Uppercase the X and Y in these terms. x coordinate (n), x-coordinate (adj.) XNOR (adj.), XNOR (n, v) Example (adj.): XNOR gate XOR (adj.), XOR (n, v), XORed (v) Example (adj.): XOR gate y-axis (n, adj.) y coordinate (n), y-coordinate (adj.) Zener (n, adj.) zero-crossing (n, adj.) zeroed (v) zero-extend (v) zeroing (v) zeroize (n), zeroization (n) zero-padded (v), zero-padding (n, adj.) zero-point energy (n) zone architecture, zonal module Not zonal architecture and zone module. Texas Instruments Custom Notes 3D Also 2D. abbreviations and acronyms Minimize the number of acronyms in your writing. Do not use an acronym if the spelled-out term appears only once. For example, do not make brushless DC into the acronym BLDC if there are no other mentions of an BLDC in the TI communication. When you do use an acronym: • Always place the acronym after its spelled-out term, never before. • Lowercase the individual words of an acronym unless it is a proper noun; if you are not sure, search the term and capitalize only if consistent with the vast majority of hits. • After defining an acronym, use it for every reference going forward, for consistency. If you want to say analog-to-digital converter every time, don’t define it as ADC at all. • Do not use SoC to mean state of charge because our industry recognizes SoC as system on chip. Do not use SW because it will not be clear to readers whether you mean software or switch. • When you use an acronym, say the words out loud in your head to be sure that you are not about to use a descriptive noun that is already in the acronym. So for example, the last word in the ASIL acronym is "Level," so if the descriptive noun is "level," that's redundant; you'd be saying Automotive Safety Integrity Level level. Here are more examples: PCB board, TSSOP package, ATM machine, MCU controller, DCR current sensing, ADAS systems, TLS security, CAN network and LIN network are all redundant. Plurals Make the acronym plural if the term you are turning into an acronym is a plural. Do not use an apostrophe; the acronym is a plural, not a possessive. The two exceptions are advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and battery management systems (BMSs). Do not make ADAS into ADASs or BMS into BMSs. Incorrect: microcontrollers (MCU) microcontrollers (MCU's) Correct: microcontrollers (MCUs) (About microcontrollers – note that we do not include the word "unit" when defining the MCU acronym.) Possessives Make the spelled-out term possessive, not the acronym. Incorrect: Other heat-generating devices can potentially affect the analog-to-digital converter (ADC’s) temperature if they are in close proximity to the LDO. Correct: Other heat-generating devices can potentially affect the analog-to-digital converter's (ADC) temperature if they are in close proximity to the LDO. No need to spell out When the Associated Press decides that an acronym has enough recognition that there is no need to define it, it will say that the acronym is "acceptable in all uses." There are only a handful of terms from the high-tech industry on this list. They include: AC API CEO CPU DC GUI HDMI HTTP IT LTE PC PIN (for personal identification number, not for pins on a device) R&D RAM S&P 500 SD SUV USB 3G, 4G, 5G HD, LCD, LED and 4K are acceptable on first reference, but should be spelled out and explained if a story dives into technological detail. Acronyms in titles It’s OK to use an acronym in a title without defining it, as long as it’s defined somewhere in the text. Alphabetization When alphabetizing a list of acronyms, compare letter by letter and ignore any punctuation marks such as hyphens, periods or slashes. Example: RFID goes before RF/IF. ages Always use numerals for the ages of people and animals. Example: Forty-eight TIers between ages 22 and 63 and children of TIers as young as 7 competed in 21 events during the competition. Follow the rules for numbers in all other cases. Example: Jacinto™ technology celebrates its one-year anniversary. A numeral is presumed to be an age when no unit of time is mentioned. Example: The engineer, 35, is the youngest ever to win the award. Use hyphens for ages when they serve as adjectives. Example: R.J.'s 8-year-old daughter wrote a class paper about Jack Kilby. among, between Here's a TI-specific example of between (distinguishing between a just a few) and among (distinguishing between many): Example: Unicast communications are secured by a 128-bit link key shared between two devices, while broadcast communications and any network layer communications are secured by a 128-bit key shared among all devices. ampersand (&) Use the ampersand only when it is part of a formal name of an organization. Otherwise, do not use “&” in place of the word “and.” Examples: Technology & Manufacturing Group Environmental, Safety & Health apostrophe (’) Do not use an apostrophe to form a plural: INCORRECT See specific’s below. Learn more about TMS320 DSP’s. TI’ers should bike to work Tuesday. CORRECT See specifics below. Learn more about TMS320 DSPs. TIers should bike to work Tuesday. This rule applies even if the word is an acronym, a number or a plural: Examples: Four VIPs were among those attending. The manufacturing process dates back to the 1990s. Speakers should avoid “umms” and “you knows.” If a common plural noun or a proper singular noun ends with the letter s, add only an apostrophe: Examples: Manufacturers’ published information Texas Instruments’ eXpressDSP™ software If ownership of what is possessed is joint (and equal), add ’s only after the second word: Example: The TMP421 and TMP422’s built-in local temperature sensors autoconfiguration (n) Not auto-configuration. because, since Reserve the use of “due to” to refer to debt. Such constructions in Texas Instruments content should be extremely rare. In constructions implying an effect, say "because of." "Since" is an adverb meaning "from then until now" or "between then and now." blackout, brownout Both blackout and brownout are one word, whether used as a noun or as an adjective. Bluetooth Bluetooth® Low Energy Never abbreviate Bluetooth Low Energy to BLE, as that's a violation of their trademark guidance: "The Bluetooth word mark must not be abbreviated, displayed as an acronym, or otherwise truncated." However, on Feb. 22, 2022, the Bluetooth special interest group sent out a quarterly notification that included guidance indicating permission to abbreviate Low Energy to LE. The rules of defining an acronym will still apply on first reference. Thus, in content with multiple references to this technology, on first reference, the correct phrase is: Bluetooth® Low Energy (LE) Note the italics, only on first reference, for Bluetooth. On subsequent references, you can say (if you choose to make Low Energy into an acronym, as using acronyms is always optional): Bluetooth LE The Bluetooth brand guide is downloadable here. Capitalize the phrase "Channel Sounding" when writing about Bluetooth Channel Sounding technology. capitalization Capitalize the proper name of a TI product. In regular text (not upstyle titles), do not capitalize common-noun descriptions of TI products such as evaluation module, software development kit or operational amplifier. Only capitalize the product’s name: Examples: C6452 DSP evaluation module. TMS320C6000™ integrated circuit. KeyStone™ multicore architecture. PCA9518 expandable five-channel I2C hub. Code Composer Studio™ integrated development environment. The Courier-115 demo kit includes a temperature logger. TI offers several C2000™ development kits based on the ControlCARD™ controller subsystem concept, including two DC/DC developer’s kits and an AC/DC kit. Lowercase common-noun elements of proper names in all plural uses. Example: The article compared the platforms of the Republican and Democratic parties on tech issues. Exceptions • Capitalize someone's last name. Examples: fast Fourier transform Hall effect sensor • Capitalize the names of standards, protocols and interfaces: Examples: Local Interconnect Network Controller Area Network Do not use all capital letters for company names or protocols, even if that’s how the company branded it, if the word is pronounceable: Examples: Hiperface, not HIPERFACE Nvidia, not NVIDIA Celsius The Associated Press does not use the degree symbol ° because it won't translate through news wires. Since that is not a factor in TI content, use ° between the number and C when referring to temperature. Example: -55°C to +175°C Do not use the degree symbol ° when the context refers to orientations such as 90, 180 or 360 degrees. Instead, spell out the word degrees. Example: Stepper motors need electrical commutation by energizing the two phase windings with periodic current waveforms that are 90 degrees different in their phase angles. cleanroom (n) As noted in the TI Writing Council meeting on Nov. 13, 2024. climate change, climate crisis TI takes exception to not making the term "greenhouse gases" into the acronym GHG. There is no reason to make an exception for this one term given that it does have significant recognition (it's in the Wikipedia entry), while also considering that we regularly make hundreds if not thousands of terms at TI into acronyms. colon (:) TI-specific examples of capitalizing a complete sentence that appears after a colon: Example: So two questions arise: Which protocol should your equipment support, and can you enable multiple protocols? Example: Monocular and binocular depth cues have a critical difference: Monocular cues arise directly from the visible light signals reflected or emitted from an object, whereas binocular cues arise from signals generated within the HVS. comma (,) Technical Documentation and Digital Marketing agreed that Tech Docs can use the serial comma in technical documentation if it is needed in December 2021. While in general TI style is not to use the Oxford comma, clarity is the overriding principle in any context for any TI content, and the rules below do not prohibit use of the comma in technical documentation when needed. Here is TI-specific guidance about using the serial or Oxford comma in marketing content that echoes the guidance above. • Use commas to separate elements in a series, but do not put a comma before “and” or another conjunction in a simple series: These MCU families deliver scalable performance, connectivity, memory and safety features. • Note that nearly all languages into which we translate TI content do not use the serial comma in a series. There are two exceptions where you would use a serial comma: • When an integral element of the series contains a conjunction (like “and” or “or”). • When the elements in the series are complex phrases. Example of a simple series: These MCU families deliver scalable performance, connectivity, memory and safety features. Example of the first exception: TI offers a complete portfolio of high-speed ADCs to support advanced communications, instrumentation, video and imaging, and radar applications. Example of the second exception: If you decide to elect a 2007 lump-sum distribution, you must initiate the pension payment process, retire from TI by Nov. 1, and properly submit the pension election authorization form. Examples of comma use in introductory clauses: In addition, the amplifier is free from output inversion. With the SimpliciTI™ network protocol, MCU resource requirements are minimal. In the area of leadership, survey respondents indicated that TI’s business strategy is sound. You may omit the comma after short phrases if no ambiguity would result: In sleep mode the quiescent supply current is typically less than 50 mA. but: For decades, TIers have been committed to United Way. company names Abbreviate the words company, corporation, incorporated and limited when used after the name of a corporate entity. The proper abbreviations are Co., Corp., Inc. and Ltd. See the Custom Stylebook entry "Texas Instruments" for an explanation of how to refer to our company. compose, comprise, constitute If a list is complete, use “comprise” (where the whole comprises the parts, never the parts comprising the whole); if the list is incomplete, use “include.” composition titles TI takes exception to capitalizing the word "with" in a composition title. contractions Contractions are acceptable in TI English-language communications and even desirable when seeking a conversational tone. Do not use contractions in a data sheet. Example with contractions: It’s the right thing to do and has always been a part of TI’s culture – to know what’s right and do what’s right. Example without contractions: It is the right thing to do and has always been a part of TI’s culture – to know what is right and do what is right. crossover cross over (v) CT scan (Just FYI) – CAT is an acronym for computerized axial tomography. currency conversions Correct: US$ American dollars Incorrect: $US U.S.$ USD$ dash (—) TI examples to indicate an abrupt change in a sentence: Wider channels – and the fact that multiple data users can use the same channel and share resources – improves both accessibility and bandwidth utilization. Success is how our customers judge us – I mean paying customers. When a phrase that would be set off by commas contains words that must be separated by commas: Two TI sites – Baguio, Philippines, and Taipei, Taiwan – received TI Environmental, Safety & Health (ESH) Excellence Awards. data Treat as a singular noun; this is an exception to AP, which in March 2019 amended their entry to say that academic and scientific writing should use plural verbs and pronouns with "data." Example: The data upholds the previously asserted theory. One solution to avoid awkward constructions is to add a term that is obviously singular or plural after the word "data": "the data files are stored" or "a data item is retrieved." database One word as a noun or adjective. dates Use numerals when writing dates and years. Do not use ordinals such as 1st, 2nd and 3rd. See the months entry for which months to abbreviate and which months to spell out. Examples: March 7, July 31 1930, 2007 differ from, differ with Avoid "different than." dimensions Use the word "by" in regular text. Use the multiplication symbol (×) in a table or other space-constrained content. Ensure that any qualifiers such as package types are in a separate column or row. Specify a single measurement type in the measurement column header (such as millimeters) such that your row would then say 5 × 5. do's and don'ts TI takes exception to AP’s entry and prefers dos and don’ts – the difference is that we do not put an apostrophe in do's. These words are not being used as possessive actors. They are being used as the plurals of do and don't. dropout Also one word as an adjective. Earth You may also see earth to refer to dirt or ground in TI communications. Do not capitalize in these contexts. Capitalize Earth when referring to the planet Earth. e.g. Use "for example," instead. Not interchangeable with "i.e." ellipsis ( ... ) Put one space on either side of the three periods that constitute an ellipses. em dash, en dash, hyphen To indicate an interruption of thought greater than a comma: TI uses the en-dash (–) surrounded by one space on either side, not hyphens (-) nor em-dashes (—). To indicate a range: TI uses "to" or suspensive hyphenation, meaning that the hyphen acts as hyphenated modifier. Examples: For adapters from 50 W to 250 W, the standard requires standby power below 150 mW. For 50- to 250-W adapters, the standard requires standby power below 150 mW. To insert an en-dash in a document: On a PC: • Hold down the Alt key and type 0150 on the numeric keypad. • On a keyboard with no numeric keypad, use a Fn (Function) key combination to type the numbers. On a Mac: • Hold down the Option key (sometimes it's labeled the Alt key) and click the hyphen key. entitled Use "titled" when referring to the name of a document, like a book or application note. Example: The book is titled "Digital Signal Processing for Dummies." exclamation point (!) Avoid exclamation points in business writing. If a sentence is mildly exclamatory, use a period. INCORRECT Don’t forget to view our latest archives! New update available! Register today! Click here to learn more! If you do choose to include an exclamation point, never use more than one. Keep in mind the writer William Zinsser's admonition that even one exclamation point "has a gushy aura, the breathless excitement of a debutante commenting on an event that was exciting only to her: 'Daddy says I must have had too much champagne!'" Fahrenheit The Associated Press does not use the degree symbol ° because it won't translate through news wires. Since that is not a factor in TI content, use ° between the number and C when referring to temperature. Example: 200°F Do not use the degree symbol ° when the context refers to orientations such as 90, 180 or 360 degrees. Instead, spell out the word degrees. Example: Stepper motors need electrical commutation by energizing the two phase windings with periodic current waveforms that are 90 degrees different in their phase angles. FAQ Because the "Q" in FAQ stands for "questions" (plural), it is only necessary to write FAQs with an "s" when referring to several discrete sets of frequently asked questions: Example: The site’s FAQ on semiconductors is popular, but the site also features FAQs dealing with nanotechnology, photovoltaics/solar cells, displays and optoelectronics. GPN, OPN, part, part number, device, product, integrated circuit, chip, component The OPA333 is a product. OPNs are contained within a product. The OAP333AID is a part. handheld TI takes exception to the hyphen in hand-held as an adjective. We use handheld as a noun and handheld as an adjective. Example: The bqTINY™ series includes highly integrated linear charge management devices targeted at handheld applications. hyphen (-) TI examples of using hyphens for compound modifiers: A triple-buffer amplifier CD-quality audio The lowest-power, lowest-cost DSPs No hyphens (because "very" and words ending in "-ly" are the exceptions): A very high pulse rate Highly optimized cache Examples of suspensive hyphenation: Experts debated fixed- versus floating-point architectures in the podcast. A business may receive the bulk of its goods by one- or two-day shipping and its invoices by mail. i.e. Use "that is," instead. Not interchangeable with "e.g." jargon These terms are considered jargon in corporate contexts (including TI). When used in TI content, consider whether these terms will translate easily, and whether readers will comprehend them as truly meaningful additions to the sentence: • Close the loop • Loop in • Disruption • Move the needle • Unpack • Debrief • Think outside the box • Holistic approach • At capacity • Bandwidth (to mean availability) • Stakeholder (to mean anyone other than a literal TI stakeholder) • Change agent • Ping • Hop on a call • Lean in • Pain point(s) • Pushback • Value added • Value proposition • Pivot • Align • Win-win • Buy in • Huddle • Liaise • Touch base • Circle back • Deep dive • Robust • Optics • Silo junior, senior Example: Charles Russell Jr. from UT Dallas was a runner-up in the Vision for Voice contest. Kelvin scale Lowercase kelvin (n) when referring to thermal volts. Uppercase Kelvin (n, adj.) when referring to the Kelvin scale. lidar The proper treatment of lidar is all lowercase (a change from all caps, approved within TI June 4, 2020). Lidar is an abbreviation for light detection and ranging (sometimes laser detection and ranging). The Lidar Base Specification from the U.S. Geological Service lowercases lidar, and the Associated Press added the term to its Stylebook on May 27, 2020 (above), also all lowercase. Technical Documentation at TI is in agreement with all-lowercase lidar as well. lifetime One word as an adjective as well. lists, bulleted lists The preferred way to create a bullet list at TI in Microsoft Word is to click the Bullets button, which you’ll find in the Home tab of the ribbon. Next, left-justify the bullet list (in other words, undo the automatic indentation) by highlighting the bulleted items and clicking the Decrease Indent button, also found in the Home tab of the ribbon, until they are fully left-justified. Capitalize the first word of and add a period to all bulleted items (the phrases) in a bullet list, per the rule given above, with one exception: Do not use periods in bullet lists that are in a heading/ list structure (such as an agenda in a PowerPoint presentation or the Features list in a data sheet) where none of the bulleted items contain a complete sentence. Do not use semicolons or commas at the end of bulleted items or the word “and” between the last two items. Each item in a bullet list must grammatically complete the introduction to the bullet list. The introduction is the first part of a sentence. The bulleted item completes the sentence. You want the items to have parallel constructions. Incorrect example of bad parallelism: This is the first installment of a four-part series that offers: • Practical tips and tricks. • How-to instructions from a system-level perspective. • Get the most from an integrated circuit. “This is the first installment of a four-part series that offers get the most from an integrated circuit” is not grammatical. Correct example of everything: capitalization, punctuation, grammatical completion: The software offers these features: • Content management tools to integrate your systems. • Ready-to-implement algorithms to shorten your time to market. • Production-tested encoders, decoders, codecs and other media software modules to simplify programming. If a term is repeated for each item in the list, include it in the introductory statement to avoid repetition, unless you want deliberate emphasis. You can also use a bullet list after a heading or subheading, but only if every bulleted item is a complete sentence. Example: Become an advocate • Spread the word on how the Women of TI Fund is an effective vehicle to increase the number of girls pursuing STEM degrees. • Serve as a mentor and role model. mid- Examples: mid-2016 mid-August millimeter Use mm with a number in TI content, but spell out millimeters in generic references. Examples: 300-mm fab; there are only a few millimeters between probes. months TI takes exception to the removal of the period with a month six letters or longer if it appears in a table. This way, we can be consistent when referring to dates that appear with a day throughout all types of content. Do not include the year in a date if it is clear from the context that you are talking about the current year. multi- multiantenna (n) multibyte (adj.) multicell (adj.) multichannel (adj.) Multichannel Audio Serial Port (n; see acronym McASP) multichip (adj.) multicycle (n, adj.) multielement (adj.) multifunction (adj.) multifunctional (adj.) multilayer (adj.) multimaster (adj.) multimeter (n) multimillion-dollar (adj.) multimedia (n, adj.) multimode (adj.) multipath (n, adj.) multiphase (adj.) multiplexer (n) multiplier (n) multipurpose (adj.) multiprotocol (adj.) multirail (adj.) multistage (adj.) multistandard (adj.) multistep (adj.) multitarget (adj.) multiyear (adj.) names For both TIers and non-TIers, in both internal and external communications, we use full names on first reference and first names on second reference. This is for the sake of being consistent and sounding conversational. Examples: Adam Kunzman, DLP® HDTV business manager, is Adam Kunzman on first reference and Adam on subsequent references. SEMI Board Chairman Douglas Neugold is Douglas Neugold on first reference and Douglas on subsequent references. No. TI uses "No." when it appears in content with a numeral. Note the capital “N” in No. Examples: Clock management implementation No. 2 is shown in Figure 3. The annual expo is billed as the world's No. 1 residential electronic systems industry show. TI uses "number" when it appears in content without a numeral. Example (in a data-sheet description): Port number, frequency, data, duty cycle Also see the "pound symbol (#)" entry. non- nonconfigurable (adj.) nonconnected (adj.) nondefault (adj.) nondeterministic (adj.) nondirectional (adj.) nondiscrete (adj.) nonelectric (adj.) nonfunctional (adj.) noninverted, noninverting (adj.) nonlinear (adj.) nonlinearity (n) nonmultiplexed (adj.) nonresponsive (adj.) nonretention (n) nonscannable (adj.) nonsynchronous (adj.) nonvolatile (adj.) nonzero (n) numerals Examples: The decoder feeds a seven-segment bipolar output driver. TI also will award 20 first prizes to 10 students and 10 teachers. When you have numbers above and below 10 in the same sentence, apply the appropriate guidelines: Examples: Available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The analog features of the TAS3208 include 10 stereo input pairs and three stereo output pairs. Nine of the top 10 base station original equipment manufacturers use TI technology. Investigate what happens when you multiply 111 times a two-digit number with a digit sum greater than nine. When using ordinals, do not superscript the “st,” “nd,” “rd” or “th” in an ordinal number. onboard Also one word as a verb. online It is redundant to write that "more information is available online at" and then provide the URL. In other words, "online" is redundant. Correct: More information is available at www.TI.com. organic LED (OLED) (n.) LED is one of the few acronyms that the Associated Press does not require defining on first reference. organizations and institutions If a descriptive noun describing the organization is not part of the organization’s name, do not capitalize it. Examples: The New York Times newspaper Time magazine Capitalize common nouns only when they are an integral part of the full name of an organization: Examples: TI Freising hopes to grow business by hosting East Europe Day. Application-specific software is available from TI and Third Party Network companies. (Note that there is no hyphen in the DSP Third Party Network.) over- overcurrent (n, adj.) overdrive (v) overestimate (n, v) overload (n, v) overloaded (adj.) overrange (adj.) overrun (n, v) oversampling (n, adj.) overshoot (n, v) overtemperature (n, adj.) overtime (n, adv.) overvoltage (n, adj.) overcurrent (n, adj.) overwrite (v, adj.) percent, percentage, percentage points The Associated Press moved away from using the word "percent" in March 2019. TI's previous guidance to use the word "percent" in formal content like the annual report and press releases now shifts to the % symbol in all cases. Regarding the "casual uses" sentence of the AP entry, we do not encounter sentences like this in TI content. The previous guidance to spell out the percentage (the number) if it begins a sentence is also changing. Previous (now incorrect) example: Twenty-eight percent of the department's budget had been spent on travel to conventions across the nation. Correct example: 28% of the department's budget had been spent on travel to conventions across the nation. In April 2024, the TI Writing Council chose to make an exception to the guidance about "zero percent" above. Do not spell out the word zero, and do not spell out the word percent. We do not encounter this percentage value often in TI content, but if you do, it should be 0% for consistency with the guidance for any other number. periods (.) Examples of spaces between sentences: Correct Mozilla has a built-in news reader. Internet Explorer uses Outlook Express as its news reader. Incorrect Mozilla has a built-in news reader. Internet Explorer uses Outlook Express as its news reader. Example of periods and commas inside quotation marks: “We have to come up with breakthrough products that allow our customers to enable new applications and differentiate products in the marketplace,” Mike said. “We have an unbounded opportunity for growth if we do our job right.” post- postamplifier (n) postlayout (n, adj.) postscaler (n) pre- preamplifier (n) prebias (n, adj.) prebuild (v) prebuilt (adj.) precharge (n, adj.) predriver (n) preemphasis network (n) preemphasize (v) prefetch (n, v) preloaded (v, adj.) pre-regulated (v) preregulator (n) prescale (adj.) prescaler (n) prescaling (v) preset (n, v, adj.) presupply (n, adj.) quasi- (adj.), quasi (n) The word "quasi-ideal," when used as an adjective, is hyphenated. question mark (?) Example of Q&A format (organizing the questions and answers into their own paragraphs, using the letters "Q" and "A" followed by a colon): Q: As one of our preferred suppliers, how have you leveraged your relationship with TI to market your business to others? A: We always reference our business relationship with TI to prospective customers. Do not put the questions and answers in quotation marks. quotation marks (" ") Do not use quotation marks for colloquial language. Also, following Technical Documentation style, consider overtly explaining that an unfamiliar term "is referred to as" or "may also be known as." If you explain the term, you don't have to then put it in quotes. Example: The radio processor subsystem (also known as the built-in self test [BIST] subsystem) includes the digital front-end, the ramp generator and an internal processor. self- self-capacitance (n, v) self-check (n) self-checking (adj.) self-contained (adj.) self-impedance (n, adj.) self-inductance (n, adj.) self-test (n, adj.) self-turnon (n) semicolon (;) Example of indicating separation of thought: TIers worldwide should comply with TI values and ethics and with the “Code of Business Conduct”; managers are held accountable for this compliance. Example of clarifying a series: This includes dramatic improvements in voice clarity and loudness; support for a range of advanced features, including enhanced color display, FM stereo, MP3 ringtones and MP3 playback; and battery life. Note that the semicolon is proper before the final “and” in such a series. shutdown Also one word as an adjective. shut-off TI takes exception to shut-off as a noun and makes shutoff one word as a noun and as an adjective. slash (/) Given issues that TI has encountered with translation of the slash, its use is restricted. Do not use a slash for constructions in which its purpose is to group words. Instead, replace the slash with the word "and" or the word "or" – whatever is most applicable and technically accurate. Incorrect examples: assert/deassert, pullup/pulldown, transmit/receive, on/off Correct revisions: assert or deassert, pullup and pulldown, transmit or receive, on or off You can use a slash in these instances: • The initialisms I/O and AC/DC. • As a divisor in an equation. Example: Gain, k = 1 + ((D2 − D1) / (X2 − X1)) • In a unit of measure. Example: V/µs. • Slashes that appear in software code. • When it appears in a module name. Example: • When it appears in a specification or protocol. Example: TCP/IP. • Only in TI product descriptions: engineering shorthand for the number of channels. Example: 4/0 to mean four forward channels and zero reverse channels. Never place spaces on either side of a slash, with one exception: • Using the slash (or the math symbol ∕ ) as a divisor in an equation. spouse When referring to TI employees or the people with whom they are married or in a committed relationship, use the more inclusive "spouses" or "same-gender domestic partner." stand-alone This term can be used as an adjective or a noun. Always hyphenate. Example (adj.): There are specific scenarios for a stand-alone radar sensor, host processor with a single radar sensor and host processor with multiple radar sensors. Example (n): The evaluation board can work stand-alone or plugged into the MSP430™ LaunchPad™ development. startup Two words as a verb: start up. state names Examples: TI's New Hampshire site reopened Thursday after the site was flooded earlier this week. TI’s site in Manchester, New Hampshire, reopened Thursday after the site was flooded earlier this week. The Philadelphia field sales office was not affected. Do not abbreviate Texas. Example: Texas Instruments Incorporated is headquartered in Dallas, Texas. Use two-letter state postal abbreviations only in mailing addresses. sub- subaddress (n) subassembly (n) subband (n) subblocks (n) subchip (n) subcommand (n) subfield (n) subharmonic (n, adj.) submodule (n) subpriority (n, adj.) subrate (n) subsecond (n) subsection (n) subsystem (n) subtracter (n) subvector (n) telephone numbers At TI, we append the plus sign to the country code but follow the rest of the guidance above because of this Ask the Editor question: QUESTION on July 7, 2020 Is it recommended to include a country code with a phone number in a communication to an international audience? The number is provided so the audience can access a Zoom webinar. If so, how should it be formatted? Zoom provides it as +1 123 456 7890. ANSWER We don't address that. I would recommend using the country code. The way you have it formatted looks fine. Thus, our official guidance for international phone numbers is to use the plus sign for the country code and to break the numbers the way each country locally displays its phone numbers, using hyphens between the breaks. Example: +44-012-3456-7890 tera- Make "teraoperations" all one word. that, which (pronouns) Another way to say essential and nonessential is to say restrictive and nonrestrictive. Use “that” with restrictive clauses and “which” with nonrestrictive clauses. A restrictive clause limits – or restricts – the subject of the sentence, further defining it in some way. A nonrestrictive clause provides interesting information but does not define the subject. Examples: TI offers OMAP™ processors that support cellular standards. The OMAP processor, which is used in many types of applications, is ideal for supporting cellular standards. In the first example, the point or emphasis is on the support for cellular standards. But in the second example, the fact that the OMAP processor is used in many types of applications is essentially an aside; it is ancillary or incidental information that informs but is not critical to the point of the sentence. Set off nonrestrictive clauses that begin with “which” with commas. Do not use a comma before the word “that.” Who and whom vs. that "Who" is the correct pronoun for references to human beings. The pronoun "who" is grammatically the subject (never the object) of a sentence, clause or phrase. Use "whom" when someone is the object of a verb or preposition. See the "who, whom" entry for examples. "That" is used for references to organizations and other nonhuman subjects. Examples: The team that organized the project celebrated. The company that brought the product to market went public. timeout Two words as a verb: time out. time zones TI takes exception to the addition of "standard" or "daylight" time. When referencing time zones in the U.S., use these terms: Central time Eastern time Mountain time Pacific time Do not include whether it is standard or daylight time or use abbreviations indicating this (CDT, CST). This alleviates complications that often arise during the conversion to and from Daylight Saving Time. Examples: noon Eastern time 9 a.m. Pacific time titles Examples: Dr. Larry Hornbeck invented DLP® technology. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (D-Texas) was supportive of the proposal. Retired Maj. Gen. Mary Saunders knows what it takes to be a leader. touch screen TI treats touchscreen as one word, as both a noun and and as adjective. Please ignore the space in touch screen and the hyphen in touch-screen in the AP Stylebook examples given above. trademark A trademark is a proper adjective followed by a generic noun or phrase that describes the products or services sold under the trademark. See the list of products for which TI uses the ™ symbol here (http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/legal/trademark/tradeservice.htm). On first reference, use the ™ symbol to indicate that TI claims exclusive trademark rights to a word, words or logo. After every reference, use an approved noun for the TI trademarked product, listed here (http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/legal/trademark/tradeservice.htm). Do not capitalize these approved nouns. They are generic noun phrases and not part of the actual product name. Examples: CapTIvate™ touch microcontroller D-CAP3™ control mode MicroStar BGA™ integrated circuit package SimpleLink™ software development kit ultra- Exceptions (ultra- with a hyphen): ultra-high (adj.) ultra-high frequency (n) ultra-high-frequency (adj.) ultra-low (adj.) ultra-low power (n) ultra-low-power (adj.) under- TI examples: undercurrent (n, adj.) underrun (n, v) undershoot (n, v) undervoltage (n, adj.) undercurrent (n, adj.) URL The www prefix With the exception of TI.com, include the "www." prefix when writing a URL. Examples (replace with TI pages): www.digikey.com www.arm.com Punctuating a URL If a URL appears at the end of a sentence, use a period like you would normally. Example: For learn more about the call for technical session papers for APEC 2019, see www.apec-conf.org. who, whom Examples: The woman who rented the room left the window open. Whom do you wish to see? The engineer who worked on the project was late. Wi-Fi This abbreviation for wireless fidelity contains two capital letters and a hyphen. Note the use of the registration mark: Wi-Fi®. work force`

Define the primary audience (employees, customers, investors, partners, or the general public). Establish the desired emotional tone (formal, inspiring, educational, persuasive, or lighthearted). 2 Key Messaging & Narrative Arc: Structure the script with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Ensure key takeaways are communicated succinctly and memorably. Use a mix of engaging storytelling, factual content, and persuasive techniques. 3 Scene-by-Scene Breakdown: Describe the visuals accompanying each part of the script (e.g., animations, on-screen text, voice-over, interviews). Include camera directions where necessary (e.g., 'Close-up of CEO speaking,' 'Cut to employee testimonials'). Specify on-screen graphics, callouts, or branded elements. 4 Dialogue & Voiceover Guidelines: Ensure conversational and engaging language while maintaining professionalism. Adapt tone and language to suit the corporate audience (avoid jargon unless necessary). Keep sentences concise and impactful for clarity in voiceover delivery. 5 Call-to-Action & Final Impression: Conclude with a strong CTA (if applicable), reinforcing the message and prompting action. Ensure the ending aligns with the company’s brand ethos and communication strategy. 6 Formatting Requirements: Present the script in a professional format: Speaker (Narrator/Interviewee), Dialogue, Visual Direction, and Additional Notes. Use clear section breaks and timestamps if necessary. Deliver the final script in a structured, easy-to-follow format, ensuring it is polished, engaging, and ready for production.
